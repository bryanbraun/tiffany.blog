You are a productivity junkie. Getting Things Done™ is a trait of the most successful among us. Being well-read is a secret weapon of every CEO and thought-leader from antiquity to modernity.

I read this as an audible book and it was by far one of the best books I read this year. I bought it in paperback just to re-absorb the nuggets of wisdom Cal sprinkles throughout the book. While it is aimed at recent college grads, everyone can gain some insights from this seminal book.

This book helps you&nbsp;to understand the todo list, how it fits into our lives, and how we can work with it. Understanding the why of any behavior is the perfect way to change that behavior. This book will get you on that path to making your to-do list work for you.

I originally picked up this book a couple years ago when I began to take my passion for productivity seriously. At that time it was the same book released in 2001. I couldn't get through it. Picked it up again and it's definitely a game-changer for me.

I am still working through this audiobook. Will it be a substitute for an MBA? No. But can you be successfully implement the tactics in this book? Certainly.

Even if you don't want to start a million dollar business, this is definitely a keeper.

This is the follow-up to The Power of Habit and it doesn't disappoint. If you want to learn how successful people and companies outperform the competition, this book is the one you want. Charles gives a lot of real world anecdotes that make sense in context. Pick it up, it's a great read.

I haven't started this book though I have purchased it. I plan on reading <em>Your Money&nbsp;</em>first before this one. Wealth acquisition and management is important to your long-term success. It's a good time as any to think about investing.

This is the first book I read by Duhigg and it changed the way I choose to do things. It offers you an insight into the why of your behaviors backed by science and hints at how to undo your evolutionary defects. Currently reading The Willpower Instinct by Dr. Kelly McGonigal which is excellent also.

Personally, this is something I struggle with getting a handle on. Some of us could benefit from learning how to get a handle on our finances, which is why there are tools like <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> and <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">You Need a Budget</a>. This book can augment those awesome tools, which I both use.

This book has opened up a whole new world of GTD principles and concepts to me I otherwise wouldn't have figured out myself, as GTD is a broad, sometimes complex, system. Highly recommended.

Deep Work is such a well-traveled, oft-talked about productivity book. I listened to the audiobook, much like his other book, and immediately bought the hardcover to help retain the golden nuggets in the book. Great read and worth the deep reflection you're sure to feel after reading it.
