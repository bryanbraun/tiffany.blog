*It's been a long week so the review is not here yet. It's coming. I promise.*

## ...To be honest...

There's really not much to say about this bag that I didn't say in [Retiring the Old Everyday Carry and Go Pack](https://tiffanywhite.blog/2019/07/18/retiring-the-old-everyday-carry-and-go-pack/).

But I *did* just buy the Peak Designs bag I've been wanting for two years...

Review to come!!
