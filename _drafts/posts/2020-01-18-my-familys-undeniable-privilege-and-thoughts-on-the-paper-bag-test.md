When I was with my Aunt over the holidays, we got to talking about my grandma's old car, a rare one, even for the 70s whose name I cannot recall.

*My Aunt relayed how she totalled it*.

"It was a sunny day and I was dancing in the car, not even paying much attention"

"*You* were dancing?" my mom said, as my Aunt is notoriously lacking rhythm[^1].

"Yes. Anyway I was driving and dancing and this car ran a red light and hit me, just rear-ended me. Car was totalled."

I wasn't really paying attention but was trying to. I knew that car had been totalled but I didn't know when. I thought it was in the 80s, and it very well could have been. I was a toddler in the early 80s so the details are fuzzy.

She continued,

"There was a boy there, he yelled, 'you ran a red light lady!' and I just ignored him. The cop came and told me that I would need to come down to the station and pay a fine."

At this point I am still thinking, inside my own head as she continued,

"I told that cop, 'I ain't payin no damn fine'. He nodded and took me downtown. When I went to court, the judge said, 'I know you. You're good. Now get out of here.' And so I left without paying much of anything."

*Now* I was interested. I found it odd, considering my family being black, and with today's political climate, just how that worked. It was the late 70s, early 80s. It *couldn't* have been better then could it?

I ruminated on this the entire night and decided to explore my family and it's privilege in a post.

{% notice warning %}
  When I talk about privilege here, I mean in the scope of whatever privilege a black person can have in our current system. As you read on you will see that the lighter you are, the less scary you are to those in power.

## The Olds, my grandparents

[^1]: Something apparently all black folks have. Guess whatever genesis my Aunt's genes took missed that memo.
