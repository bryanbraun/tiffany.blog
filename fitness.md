*So this is it*.

Matt D'Avella has, in a sense, saved my life as well as my sanity.

{% notice info %}
  I will reference Matt D'Avella *a lot*. Here is one of the videos that got me going.

*Not that I had any sanity to begin with.*

But I digress.

Not only have I rid myself of things I don't actually need or want, I've started to take my health more seriously. It's pretty much a necessity as a woman of a certain age.

So here is where I chronicle my journey.

I don't know if I am going to do weigh-ins here. It's hard enough living at this weight, which, as I have said, is not all my fault. I like to call it, *the medi-fats* because **Depakote is a terrible drug and should not be given to teenagers**[^1].

I have had eating disorders during my life and I have battled with this weight issue more than half that time. This is a *mindset shift*. And I want to talk about it and *especially* for those who have taken Depakote at some point in their lives. I just want y'all to know you can drop the weight and, most of it is *not. your. fault.*

*Here is where I lay my sins, wins, triumphs, and failures.*

Let's fucking go.

[^1]: Hole 'nother discussion, but for reference, a friend I was in a group home with took Depakote for her seizures in 2nd grade. She got really fat *and then* it made her develop breasts. **AT 7 YEARS OLD**. Yeah...
