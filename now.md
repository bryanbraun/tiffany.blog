Derek Sivers set up a website called [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/about) to help people understand what a now page is, why you’d want one, and to [showcase other now pages](http://nownownow.com/). Maybe you should build one, too.

## Location

I live in Swatara Twp, PA.

## Work

I was working as a junior frontend developer at [ICF](www.icf.com) and am currently looking for my next role.

## Fun Programming Side Projects

I am currently building a book finder app using create-react-app, styled-components, and the Google Books API. I am also redesigning my [portfolio](https://www.tiffanyrwhite.com) from Jekyll, which this site is built on to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Latest Interests

I am working on three blogs: this one, tiffany.blog, my book review blog, [Book Notes by Tiffany](https://booknotesbytiffany.net)[^1], a [YouTube channel called Tiff Talks Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWi0HlYe3si17IRc-dauGGg) and its [companion blog/site](https://tifftalkstech.com/), and my dev blog [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev/). I also started yet *another* dev podcast called [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.org/)[^2].

My interest in filmmaking, fitness, YouTube, and Twitch has taken me to whole new heights. My fitness blog is over at [Distinguished Fat Loss](https://distinguishedfatloss.com/) and my list of YouTube channels, Vimeo account, and Twitch account are below:

I've also become more interested in stoicism and minimalism as good practices for someone my age. [Matt D'Avella's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany), my own mortality and worsening health, and wanting to have financial freedom has really inspired me to make a change, even _before_ the start of the new year.

## Learning

I am currently still brushing up on JavaScript and getting more familiar with React. I am also learning GraphQL and soon Go at the start of the year.

## Fitness

I am currently getting back into lifting weights by creating a habit, starting small at first and working my way up to full workouts. So far, so good.

## Hobby

I've been trying to get back into [photography](https://tiffanywhite.me) as a creative outlet and excuse to get out of the house[^3].

There is only so much time in the day and I am lucky to have just my friends and no spouse or kids[^4]. Focusing on what is important is key.

What are you doing? I’m curious by nature. Share it with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twhiteblog). Or don’t. 🤷🏾‍♀️

[^1]: Name inspired by Bill Gates [Gates Notes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books).
[^2]: I need to get settled into my new apartment and also figure out who I should ask to cohost. I have a couple people in mind.
[^3]: I absolutely do not get enough time away from my desk. So I've gone on one photo walk and plan on doing more, at least once a week.
[^4]: Fine with that now and really I am too old to have kids which I still can but don't want to. My terrible, very bad, no good, relationships have prevented me from dating and _besides_ I am working on self-improvement, losing weight, getting healthy physically, mentally, and financially. Me comes first, ya dig?
