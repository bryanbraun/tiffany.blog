Derek Sivers set up a website called [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/about) to help people understand what a now page is, why you’d want one, and to [showcase other now pages](http://nownownow.com/). Maybe you should build one, too.

## Location

I live in Swatara Twp, PA.

## Work

I was working as a junior frontend developer at [ICF](www.icf.com) and am currently interviewing for new frontend or fullstack JavaScript roles. Interested in chatting? Check out my [resume](https://resume.tiffanyrwhite.com/), [portfolio](https://www.tiffanyrwhite.com/) which is being refactored, my [GitHub](https://github.com/twhite96) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tiffanyrwhite). Or, you can <a href="mailto:tiffany@tiffanyrwhite.com">come say hi</a>!

## Fun Programming Side Projects

I am currently hacking on a [static site generator using Ruby](https://github.com/twhite96/static-gen-ruby) which has been challenging as I am not a Rubyist, so things are *much different* than what I am used to in JavaScript-land. I am also working on a [Blitz.js ecommerce app](https://github.com/twhite96/blitzjs-ecommerce) to tinker with a full-stack, opinionated, web framework using React.js, Prisma, and Postgresql.
## Latest Interests

I have cut down *significantly* on the projects I give my time to. Those that didn't excite me or felt like a chore, I axed[^1]
I am working on three blogs: this one, tiffany.blog, and my dev blog [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev/).

My interest in filmmaking, fitness, and Twitch are the things I am focused on *now*[^2]. My fitness blog is over at [Scripting Fat Loss](https://scriptingfatloss.com/) and my list of YouTube channels, Vimeo account, and Twitch account are below:

**YouTube**<br />

I've also become more interested in stoicism and minimalism as good practices for someone my age. [Matt D'Avella's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany), my own mortality and worsening health, and wanting to have financial freedom has really inspired me to make a change, even _before_ the start of the new year.

## Learning

I am currently still brushing up on JavaScript and getting more familiar with React. I am also learning GraphQL and soon Go at the start of the year.

## Fitness

I am currently getting back into lifting weights by creating a habit, starting small at first and working my way up to full workouts. So far, so good.

## Hobby

I've been trying to get back into [photography](https://tiffanywhite.me) as a creative outlet and excuse to get out of the house[^3].

There is only so much time in the day and I am lucky to have just my friends and no spouse or kids[^4]. Focusing on what is important is key.

What are you doing? I’m curious by nature. Share it with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twhiteblog). Or don’t. 🤷🏾‍♀️

[^1]: Distinguished Fat Loss is a blog but no longer a YouTube channel. Tiff Talks Tech is no longer a blog or a YouTube channel, and Good First Issue was something I was struggling to do as it was just me, no co-host, which sucked. It's also *extremely* time consuming to edit and I just don't enjoy editing voice audio.
[^2]: huehuehuehue 
[^3]: I absolutely do not get enough time away from my desk. So I've gone on one photo walk and plan on doing more, at least once a week.
[^4]: Fine with that now and really I am too old to have kids which I still can but don't want to. My terrible, very bad, no good, relationships have prevented me from dating and _besides_ I am working on self-improvement, losing weight, getting healthy physically, mentally, and financially. Me comes first, ya dig?
