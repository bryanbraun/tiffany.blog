Reading [Marco Arment’s headphone reviews](https://marco.org/headphones-closed-portable), and me being the music fiend I am, I decided to dedicate some time to reviewing mid to high-end headphones that I purchase throughout the next couple years. This collection chronicles my time with entry-level audiophile headphones.

Over time I will get more general audiophile headphones and review them here.

  Listed is a criteria template I will use for each review.

## Criteria

I am going to give a rating to the following properties:

- *Comfort*: How long can I wear them before they start to hurt?
- *Style/Attractiveness*: How good looking are they? This is purely subjective.
- *Portability*: Can or should you use these during your commute?
- *Value for Price*: Is this a good buy for the money?
- *Sound*: How do they sound? Do they sound okay with a sound enhancement system or DAC? Do they sound good without one?
- *Build*: Are they made of quality materials? Do they break easily?

I will give each criterion a rating of&nbsp; <a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #339e4e; color: #ffffff;">Great</a>&nbsp;<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #f5a105; color: #ffffff;">Good</a>&nbsp;<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #e0e019; color: #ffffff;">Okay</a> <a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #de1b1b; color: #ffffff;">Bad</a>&nbsp;.Great is obviously the best you can get, Good is just slightly above average, Okay is average, and Bad is just *the worst*.

## See what's up next (well, soon enough)

You can check out my [Collection of Cans Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/tiffanywhitedev/collection-of-cans/) or my [Cans Amazon Ideas List](http://a.co/8z3OUC2) to see the absurd amounts of money I'm willing to pay for cans[^1].


[^1]: Let's be honest: the ones > $500 I am not *really* going to buy off the bat, more than likely saving for them. I am not Marco, and while I am finally, *finally* employed after a long wait making more than market rate for my title and area, I *still* just won't be Marco, not now, and probably not ever.
