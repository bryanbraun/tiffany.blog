Upgrade and The Summer of Fun and...home screens.

On [Upgrade 250: Building a Home Screen Together](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-cflM0) they have challenged each other to build their home screens. I love sharing my home screens as they are ever-changing.

This summer, I am going with some chill wallpapers, two folders on the XS Max[^1], and my newly favorite podcast, [Analog(ue)](https://overcast.fm/itunes908481520/analog-ue)'s cover art wallpaper for the iPad.

## iPhone

My iPhone screen changes *a lot*. This summer, I am trying to keep it one way and this is what I am going with.

       Two folders. I am trying to decide what photo editing app I <em>really</em> need and the 📝 is a folder full of Progressive Web App blogs. I am keeping it there for now.

## iPad Pro

My main screen is clean; I like it that way. It keeps me from being distracted when I am working. I find that I *really* like writing on the iPad[^2] so keeping things organized and clean is ideal. I am extraordinarily happy about iPadOS 13. I can't wait to put the public beta on my older iPad.

       I have two other screens because I have <em>far too many apps</em> on my iPad. The dock is where I keep anything important and I try to keep it minimal.

## Apple Watch

I keep it on the same face, always. So this is probably the only face I'll share for a while.

       I don't know the name of this face but it's what I've had pretty much the entire time I've had this Apple Watch.

[^1]: Yep! I know. You can @ me.
[^2]: This blog, my [Book Notes Blog](https://booknotesbytiffany.net), and [WTF Robots](https://wtfrobots.netlify.com) are *easily* my favorite blogs to write on the iPad Pro. I'm working on a post so stay tuned.
