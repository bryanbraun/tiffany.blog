I've moved all the apps on my iPhone to *one screen* with six folders, four strewn across the top. I'll just search for the ones I need[^1].

### iPad Pro

Not much change here. Still on iPadOS.

[^1]: Since I am moving I have a folder with the 🏡 emoji to encapsulate all the things I'll need to buy/fit into the new place, like IKEA Place. ARKit ftw, at least for this type of thing.
