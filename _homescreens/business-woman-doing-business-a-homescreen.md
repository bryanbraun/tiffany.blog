I am entering corporate life for the first time and...*it's an adjustment*.

I used a tool called [Jamf Now](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/) to manage my mom's iOS devices remotely; it's really for business users but I found it an easy way to set mom up and get her going if there were ever any issues[^1].

I never thought that I'd be on the *receiving end* of this kind of thing, but when you are in the corporate world in a company that does business with government and private entities well...

I am now a business woman doing business with her business papers[^2] in her Peak Everyday backpack.

## Home Screens!

       Everything is managed and the 💼 folder is obviously all the work stuff. I did have Outlook on the home screen but using it is against company policy.

       Never thought I'd have a chance at a retirement fund and 401k but here we are. Managing all that with Personal Captial.

       Mail.app is in my dock again because it is the only app approved for our Exchange server. I use it on iOS as well. Should probably remove it but...oh well.

[^1]: I stopped using it; renewing Apple certificates and deploying updates to mom's devices was too involved and I had little time or patience trying to learn the software.
[^2]: I just spent and hour and a half trying to find a timestamp of [Chase Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/user/chasereeves) bag review channel where he says something about a pouch in a bag being for "your papers...your business papers" in that Chase Reeves way. Check his YouTube; dude is highly entertaining and looks like Jesus. Bag Jesus. You'll thank me.
