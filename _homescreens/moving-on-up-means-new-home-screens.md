*New job, who dis*.

So I am *finally employed* as a software engineer again, this time, *not* an internship, not contract to hire, but *full-time, salaried, software engineer* for a great company.

As such, my home screens have to reflect this. I have my main home screen on my iPhone and my secondary screen has most of the things I need for work[^1]. I've also thrown in my iMac screens.

       Some of these might have to come off the main screen but for now, this is what I'm working with.

       My company is kinda corporate. So...Microsoft. I'll probably move a couple of the MS apps to the main screen.

       There are <em>a lot</em> of social apps on the main screen which...ehhh...might keep them.

       The main screen in my setup. Pretty plan, just the Cortex wallpaper, Ubersicht, and a pretty full dock that I usually hide but am just showing for the home screen collection purposes.

## New chapter, new screens

Now that I am *on to the next chapter*, I need to figure out *how* I want to structure my iPhone home screen and try to keep it that way.
