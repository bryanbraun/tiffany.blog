I am a developer and geek who writes articles on Apple, <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/twhiteblog/image/upload/c_scale,w_256/v1578436739/twhiteblog-avi.png" class="align-right" /> musings on personal things and observations, and productivity. If you want, you can find my scribblings on programming at [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev/).If you're also of the programming persuasion, you can find me as [@tiffanywhitedev](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev) on Twitter.

This blog is an amalgam of all my thoughts on Apple, productivity, health for us nerds, and, well, general technology and now with fresh linked posts.

To keep updated on new posts on Twitter, you can find me there at [@twhiteblog](https://twitter.com/twhiteblog) or you can just [subscribe to the rss](https://tiffanywhite.blog/atom.xml) or [JSON](https://tiffanywhite.blog/feed.json) feeds.
