I am a Mac Nerd who writes articles on Apple, <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/thatmacnerd/image/upload/v1539313548/About%20Page%20Photos/profile3_small.png" class="align-right" /> musings on personal things and observations, and productivity. If you want, you can find my scribblings on programming at [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.tech/).If you're also of the programming persuasion, you can find me as [TiffanyW_412](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412) on Twitter. 

This blog is an amalgam of all my thoughts on Apple, maybe, *maybe* world events, productivity, health for us nerds, and, well, general technology and now with fresh linked posts. Hope you stick around and enjoy.
