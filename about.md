I am a Mac Nerd who writes articles on Apple, musings on personal things and observations, and productivity. If you want, you can find my scribblings on programming at [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.tech/). If you're also of the programming persuasion, you can find me as [TiffanyW_412](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412) on Twitter.
