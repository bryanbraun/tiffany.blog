I am a bag kinda girl. No offense to women who love purses, but that kind of everyday carry just isn't my jam.

This collection is inspired by this man below. I don't do YouTube but I thought I'd write about bags instead.

## Criteria

I am going to give a rating to the following properties:

- *Comfort*: How does the bag feel on me? Does it fatigue my shoulders or back? Is it already heavy without a load?
- *Style/Attractiveness*: How good looking is it? Is it techie, sleek, or rustic?
- *Organization*: How many things can I fit neatly into this bag? If a travel bag, how many packing cubes can I fit in this and keep it minimal enough to fit under my seat?
- *Value for Price*: Is this a good buy for the money?
- *Build*: Is it made of quality materials? Does it fall apart easily? Does it have YKK zippers and zipper pulls?

I will give each criterion a rating of&nbsp; <a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #339e4e; color: #ffffff;">Great</a>&nbsp;<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #f5a105; color: #ffffff;">Good</a>&nbsp;<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #e0e019; color: #ffffff;">Okay</a> <a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #de1b1b; color: #ffffff;">Bad</a>&nbsp;.Great is obviously the best you can get, Good is just slightly above average, Okay is average, and Bad is just *the worst*.
