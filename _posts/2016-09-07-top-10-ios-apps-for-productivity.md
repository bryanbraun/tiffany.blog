<em>This is an updated list of iOS apps for fall</em>.

My list of <em>most used</em> apps has changed since I last wrote an article on the Best 10 Apps for Productivity on iOS.

I have tested old tools and stuck with them and abandoned new tools.

My list of tools should be different than yours. If they’re not, that’s okay, too.
<h2>My Top Apps</h2>
Most of my top apps are a rehash of the <a href="https://thatmacnerd.com/that-mac-nerd-10-best-productivity-apps-ios/">previous article</a>. I am just going to list what changed.
<ol>
 	<li><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail-your-mail-with-you/id993160329?mt=8&amp;at=+1001lnT5&amp;ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS">Airmail</a><img class="wp-image-756 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2019.png" width="164" height="334" /><img class="wp-image-759 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2018.png" width="262" height="267" />This is the power user option against Spark’s email client. Airmail has a ton of integrations built in. You can essentially send an email to OmniFocus or Evernote. Evernote integration isn’t the best; the format of the email is stripped out and the Airmail x-call-back URL is added in the note body. But there are a lot of other integrations.The read receipt feature that Spark took out of their app is in this app, as well as <em>Send Later</em> and now, <em>Undo Send</em>. Send Later is only available for Gmail and Outlook accounts at the moment, but it is still a very worthy investment.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote-capture-notes-sync/id281796108?mt=8&amp;at=+1001lnT5&amp;ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS">Evernote</a><img class="wp-image-758 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2020.png" width="189" height="385" />I tried to abandon Evernote. I really did. But from the moment I deleted my old account, I immediately regretted it. It was the cornerstone of all my information and plain text systems as well as DEVONthink Pro Office wasn’t cutting it the way I wanted it to.Evernote is in some dire straits, and I may have to jump ship eventually. But for now I paid for the Premium subscription which I got a generous discount on. I want them to stay in business so I gave them my money. It’s a fact of business: a brand build a product. You don’t give them money to sustain that product, the product dies. It’s that simple.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&amp;at=+1001lnT5&amp;ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS">OmniFocus</a><img class="wp-image-757 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2021.png" width="276" height="281" />The big gun of productivity apps on the Apple platform. They are pricey apps but worth it.I went with Todoist for half a year and it was a great system but I eventually got bored with the incentive system and the lack of power user features, even with the premium version. I went back to OmniFocus as now I know how to actually use it and the GTD method. Both of these together are something powerful.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8&amp;at=+1001lnT5&amp;ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS">PocketCasts</a><img class="wp-image-760 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2022.png" width="180" height="367" /><img class="wp-image-762 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2023.png" width="303" height="309" />I was a staunch Overcast user and patron. But when PocketCasts, my previous podcatcher got similar features that drew me to Overcast, I switched back. The interface just <em>looks</em> better— sleek and modern.One thing that really bothers me is the <em>Episode Filter</em>. It isn’t intuitive to use and it is reflected in the reviews. You <em>can</em> play the whole playlist, or episode filter, but you have to tap the three buttons by the title: of your playlist and hit <em>Play All</em>. It is a quirk, but a minor one. Now that I know how it works, it is a definite Overcast replacement.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-original/id379693831?mt=8&amp;at=+1001lnT5&amp;ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS">Audible</a><img class="wp-image-761 aligncenter" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2026.png" width="183" height="373" />I just recently found the value of audiobooks. Most of the books I read this year, all 48 of them, have been audiobooks. I am on the Platinum plan so I get two credits a month and I always use them.Audiobooks are great for commutes and gym time, a perfect time to learn something. If you don’t think you’d enjoy audiobooks, give it a try.
