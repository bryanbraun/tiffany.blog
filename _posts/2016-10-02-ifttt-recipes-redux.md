Are you still using IFTTT recipes?

I am. 

I have deleted some recipes and added others. They are adding new channels every week. A lot of it is home automation stuff the Hue and WeMo lights[footnote]And of course, the Amazon Echo.[/footnote]. That seems to be their focus and I understand that.

They asked for suggestions on their Facebook Page and I, as well  as other users suggested multiple accounts as well as more fine-tuned conditionals for greater flexibility. Seems like power-user features but one that [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) has had for a while now.

## The IFTTT Giveth and The APIs Taketh Away

One notable issue with IFTTT is that it relies so heavily on web service APIs that are constantly changing. I used Instagram’s *Save a Photo You Like on Instagram to Your Camera Roll* recipe quite often. There were several different triggers for Instagram. But because of changes to their API, they took away a lot of triggers which crippled some of my workflows.[footnote]You can find the article about that here: https://ifttt.com/blog/2016/05/a-change-in-how-instagram-works-with-ifttt[/footnote].

It isn’t ideal, but it’s what we have when services like IFTTT tap into other web apps for free.
