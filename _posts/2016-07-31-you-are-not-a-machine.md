I am trying to remember this:

You are not a machine.

[Tweet "You are not a machine."]

Working late into the night, working on weekends: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/the-alarming-long-term-consequences-of-workplace-stress/385397/" target="_blank">it’s killing us</a>.

We’re unhealthy. We don’t take time to exercise and eat right and how could we? There’s just <em>no time</em>. From emails, Slack messages, crises at work, staying late at the office, time is a lost commodity.

But there’s hope.
<h2>Setting Yourself Up for Success By Saying “Yes” to <strong>You</strong></h2>
You should be the focus of everything you do.

[Tweet "You should be the focus of everything you do."] Taking care of your body is only going to give you more energy to get things done.

Sleeping seven to eight hours a night and going to bed at a reasonable time can help you focus and ready to start your day. There’s nothing worse than being sleep deprived. Your eyes glaze over and you can't focus.

Exercise <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/exercise-happiness2.htm" target="_blank">releases endorphins</a> that make you feel happy and alive. I know when I come out of the gym, I feel <em>incredible</em>. I am trying to lose weight and get fit. The more I push myself to exercise the better I feel about myself. I have more confidence I have to tackle any of the school/work/life problems. Endorphins matter <em>that</em> much.

Eating healthy is super important to feeling good, as well. When we put good foods in our system, they fuel us and give our brains much needed energy.
<h2>Learn to Say <strong>No</strong> To Others</h2>
I struggle with this. I say yes to a lot, as someone who is in school and trying to get ahead in life faster than I did when I was younger. I would go to school, drop out, go back in an attempt to keep relationships. I was struggling with self-confidence.

Today, I have learned to say no to a lot of projects that have come my way. Saying no to other commitments, you’re signaling to others that your time is valuable. This will boost self-confidence and lead others to respect your time.
<h2>You Matter</h2>
Remember this. If you allow yourself to let others influence your behavior, you compromise your well-being.
