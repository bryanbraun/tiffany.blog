The end of the year is here and with that comes end of year mac app roundup posts of the best apps for productivity, games, and other popular app genres.

Here, at That Mac Nerd, it's no different. I have moved from app to app this past year, looking for the perfect tool. That's a fool's errand: **there is no perfect tool**, just a perfect system [note]I will write a post about systems soon[/note] and that system is unique to your own needs.

## Two Parts

While writing this post, I noticed how long it had gotten and that I had 16 apps I wanted to talk about. So instead of pumping out a very long article, I decided to break it up, two posts with 8 apps each. Same for the End of the Year iOS Productivity App Roundup.

## My Best Productivity Apps This Year

So what apps I am using are the best this year? Here's my list.

<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> - This is a workhorse for those busy folks that need to manage their tasks. This is a GTD powerhouse though you can use it for a simple list. OmniFocus is the best of the best and the app most entrepreneurs use if their on a Mac. Pricey, so make sure you're going to commit.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-12-16-2-59-AM.jpeg" width="2728" height="1610" /><a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark</a> - I know I wrote about Spark before:

https://thatmacnerd.com/that-mac-nerd-10-best-productivity-apps-ios/

and then I switched to Airmail:

&nbsp;

on Mac and iOS. Spark's Mac app was in beta and I didn't really want to test it-- I was pretty happy with the power of Airmail. Spark is powerful as well but not quite as powerful as Airmail-- the OmniFocus share extension is much, much better with Airmail. I switched over to Spark after I looked at their Mac app. It's *beautiful* and *fast*. On iOS I keep Airmail around just for that share extension but on Mac it doesn't make a difference. Spark is almost as good as Mail.app and it's *free*.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-12-16-3-11-AM.jpeg" width="2784" height="1668" /><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> - This is a must-have app. I don't know what I'd do without it, and I am not even using its full power. It's an app launcher, a web and *website* searcher, and with web APIs, AppleScript, and things like Python and JXA, you can script workflows for the apps on your machine or access web services. And with the revised workflow maker screen, you can think up and create all kinds of relevant workflows for you. You will need to pay for the PowerPack, which is around $30. Upgrades are cheap-- I got my upgrade to version 3 for $10.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-12-16-11-30-PM.jpeg" width="2784" height="1668" /><a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> - Keyboard Maestro is an app that once you play around with it, get a few macros made[note]or downloaded[/note] you won't know what you did without it. I have made, and downloaded, 184 macros that do things behind the scenes that I no longer have to think about. It has a learning curve, so make sure you are doing repeated tasks often enough to justify the time and monetary costs of this app. But, if you're willing to take a little time to learn it[note]It helps to know AppleScript, Ruby, Python of JXA but you really don't *need* to[/note].<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-908" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-12-16-11-38-PM.jpeg" width="2784" height="1670" /><a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com">Hazel</a> - If you are constantly moving files across your Mac and maybe a few external drives, or even into closed file formats like Evernote[note]Katie Floyd has a great little Hazel rule that I will share[/note], Hazel should be your first choice for this. In fact, I am pretty certain Hazel is the *only* choice for this currently. Hazel saves me so much time, and it doesn't have to be a slog to setup. Just a few rules can get you going. I wrote about my Hazel setup on Mac Automation Tips blog:

Check it out for how to get started with Hazel. Check out [Katie Floyd's Evernote Hazel rule](https://katiefloyd.com/blog/download-pdf-to-evernote-hazel-rule) as well.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-901" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-12-16-11-48-PM.jpeg" width="1504" height="1188" /><a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> - I absolutely *love* Evernote, despite the team's flaws, despite its warts, despite the uproar over their pricing model. Since Phil Libin left, the Evernote team has since regained focus, shuttling their ill-advised store and some other products that weren't at the core of who they are. I tried the plain text system of storing information, as well as a DEVONthink Pro Office system of storing info, but at the end of the day, nothing is as malleable to GTD and productivity as Evernote. I keep and use DEVONthink Pro Office as an archival database for books, videos, and pdfs that I may need to refer to later. But for my everyday, I still use Evernote. I am currently writing a book on Evernote so stay tuned.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-13-16-12-01-AM.jpeg" width="2640" height="1558" /><a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com">Scrivener</a> - With the recent release of their iOS app, Scrivener is back on my radar as a worthy tool to write non-fiction in, as well as the sundry school research papers I'll need to write. It is, in all its cluttered glory, a behemoth-- it does so much, so many bells and whistles-- but it does it in ways other software can't match. When Scrivener launched for iOS I immediately bought it and have since started two book projects. It syncs with Dropbox only: for some reason the developer said iCloud Sync didn't work correctly, however Ulysses, which also uses package files, works flawlessly with iCloud Sync. In any case, this is a must have if you're doing any type of long-form writing.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-13-16-12-10-AM.jpeg" width="2728" height="1614" /><a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> - Ulysses is the markdown app for serious writers. I write practically everything in Ulysses that isn't going to be extremely long form or things like journal entries or goals. You can put that stuff in Ulysses, but that's really not taking advantage of its power. I am currently writing this blog post in Ulysses on my iPad Pro with Logitech Smart Keyboard but the Mac app is always in my dock, always accessible. I write all my blog posts, newsletters, and scripts in Ulysses. It's an App Store app and quite pricey, like Scrivener but one of the best apps on the store.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-13-16-12-21-AM.jpeg" width="2728" height="1614" />

## Stay Tuned for Part 2

Part two has some web apps that have integrations locally on your Mac and a few utilities. The next post should be out by the end of the week.

In the meantime relax, stay motivated, and keep productive.
