The end of the year is here and with that comes end of year mac app roundup posts of the best apps for productivity, games, and other popular app genres.

Here, at That Mac Nerd, it's no different. I have moved from app to app this past year, looking for the perfect tool. That's a fool's errand: **there is no perfect tool**, just a perfect system [note]I will write a post about systems soon[/note] and that system is unique to your own needs.

## Two Parts

While writing this post, I noticed how long it had gotten and that I had 16 apps I wanted to talk about. So instead of pumping out a very long article, I decided to break it up, two posts with 8 apps each. Same for the End of the Year iOS Productivity App Roundup.

## My Best Productivity Apps This Year

So what apps I am using are the best this year? Here's my list.

<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> - This is a workhorse for those busy folks that need to manage their tasks. This is a GTD powerhouse though you can use it for a simple list. OmniFocus is the best of the best and the app most entrepreneurs use if their on a Mac. Pricey, so make sure you're going to commit.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src=" 

 

and then I switched to Airmail:

on Mac and iOS. Spark's Mac app was in beta and I didn't really want to test it-- I was pretty happy with the power of Airmail. Spark is powerful as well but not quite as powerful as Airmail-- the OmniFocus share extension is much, much better with Airmail. I switched over to Spark after I looked at their Mac app. It's *beautiful* and *fast*. On iOS I keep Airmail around just for that share extension but on Mac it doesn't make a difference. Spark is almost as good as Mail.app and it's *free*.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="

## Stay Tuned for Part 2

Part two has some web apps that have integrations locally on your Mac and a few utilities. The next post should be out by the end of the week.

In the meantime relax, stay motivated, and keep productive.
