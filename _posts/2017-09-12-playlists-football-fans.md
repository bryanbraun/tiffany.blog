  I listen to all genres of music but my
  favorite is alternative rock, metal, and
  dubstep. Eclectic mix, I know. Here is a
  playlist I discovered while browsing
  Spotify for tailgating.

I listen to music all day, everyday. My [Dylan QS1 headphones](https://thatmacnerd.com/pick-month-dylan-headphones/) on, I code, write, and surf the web with Spotify [^1].

I listen to all genres of music but my favorite is alternative rock, metal, and dubstep. Eclectic mix, I know.

I am also a football fan though I am trying to cut back on how much I watch as I work to get dev job ready [^2].

I found a few playlists that cater to tailgating. The first one was a country playlist but I can’t stand country music so I went searching for a hip-hop or rock playlist and I found this one, a rock one, with some classics and some new ones.

[^1]: And sometimes Apple Music.
[^2]: My Buckeyes got manhandled by Oklahoma. The school I went to, Pitt, never has a good football team and got handled quite easily by Penn State, which I hate for a myriad of reasons. But the Steelers look good this season, defense starting to solidify. Love to see an aggressive defense.
