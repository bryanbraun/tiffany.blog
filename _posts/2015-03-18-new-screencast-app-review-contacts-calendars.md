Being a non-traditional student, you may have a job and other commitments, more so than your younger compatriots. So, how do you take care of the day job, the night class, interviews, who’s who and who you just met? You need contact and calendar managers (if you’re not adverse to tech, which if you were, you wouldn’t be reading this).

So the two big players in these two categories on the Mac are BusyCal and BusyContacts by, well, BusyMac. BusyCal has been around a long time and it seems to be the favorite among BusyPeople. BusyContacts is version 1 but it is robust and, while it could stand to have some features, I <strong>love it</strong>.

I will be doing a screencast on each and publishing them to Vimeo and sharing them here. Stay tuned.
