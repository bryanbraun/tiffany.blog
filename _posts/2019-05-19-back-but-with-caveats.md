excerpt: This is now just a fun endeavor; don't care how long it takes to write. No pressure this time.
description: Back to the fun of just getting stuff out into the world.
---

It is pretty late right now but I have been thinking about this blog for a while lately. I enjoyed writing here. I guess, burnout and depression are real.

I am older now and my health should be *really really important to me*. And now it is. I decided that hustling till I am burned out for weeks is something I *literally* can't afford to do.

I don't code on weekends anymore, outside of one challenge at freeCodeCamp to keep up my streak.

## Weekend blogging

I code and work on things pretty much during the week until about 9 or 10pm. I then read and head to bed. I decided I like reading on my iPad Pro again.

       MapleRead is just too good and this iPad way too beautiful to ignore.

For this blog and my [other](https://booknotesbytiffany.net/) [hobby blogs](https://wtfrobots.netlify.com/), there is no pressure to actually *write* to them. Of course, everyone wants to build traffic, and as Gabe Weatherhead of Macdrifter said [in one of his latest blog posts](http://www.macdrifter.com/2019/05/a-long-hard-winter.html):

> Sites like Macdrifter run on ego . I love recognition from readers and other writers.

*Indeed*.

## Hobbies

I've taken up [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sydmalicious/) [again](https://www.eyeem.com/u/trwhite), mobile and mirrorless alike. I started a [photo portfolio](https://trwhitephoto.netlify.com/black-and-white) just for fun. I am not great at it. Yet. I was doing it more years ago and was awful at it. I've improved a bit and plan on trying to get out more on photo walks.

       My old camera was over 10 years old. This is <em>so much better</em>. Still getting used to it, but I am <em>in love with it</em>. This is the kind of quality you get with a camera like this, something an iPhone can't produce and probably never will.

### Electronics Hobby

I love working with my hands; I've put my own furniture together, built and improvised on random circuit experiments. So I stocked up on electronics components like Arduinos, a Raspberry Pi[^1], ICs[^2], transistors, resistors, switches, servo motors. You name it I have it[^3]. I have an assortment of tools that I use.

Because I like building things and DIY, I decided I'd work on a robot kit and other projects during the weekend. This has been really fun and I plan on working on it more today.

## Plans for That Mac Nerd

I have some archived ideas I plan on writing about so look for that. I may reactivate my Twitter account as well. So watch this space.

[^1]: I have two of those and like 6 different Arduino boards ha.
[^2]: Integrated Circuits, some regular and some programmable.
[^3]: Bought a proper soldering station as well.
