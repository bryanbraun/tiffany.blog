description: Second go 'round with YNAB is the charm.

[YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), or *You Need a Budget* in its long form, is a budgeting system and software that helps struggling and even savvy budgeters to reign in control of their finances.

The first time I tried it I was working and was *all in*. I skimmed the [The Four Rules](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/), [read a few of their blog posts](https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/) and BOOM I was *feeling the money rolling in and saving it*.

But somehow, there was a glitch in the system, or more likely, my brain; the software started to not make sense, I kept having to do [a fresh start](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-logic-art-of-a-ynab-fresh-start/), and, perhaps less important but still a factor, my internship ended and I was essential broke and living on fumes. I couldn't justify the $55 when it came time to renew[^1]. I canceled and deleted my account.

## New beginnings means a truly fresh start

I won't get into it; you already know I am working now. So I decided to sign up for another free trial of YNAB. I did all the things I did formerly but this time, something *clicked*. The four rules began to make sense:

1. Give every dollar a job
2. Embrace your true expenses
3. Roll with the punches
4. Age your money

The rules I want to talk about are rules 1-3.

### Give every dollar a job
So you get a paycheck. Assign each dollar a job or, just assigning those dollars to a particular category in YNAB, whatever it is that is important to you. For instance, I have a budget setup for dining out with my friends. I assign some dollars to that particular venture and I have money to *do the thing* without just spending on a whim or mood, whenever I feel like it.

### Embrace your true expenses
I have to buy a new iMac. This is a true expense: a large, infrequent purchase I need to save for. I can create a goal in YNAB to fund this goal monthly and once I hit that goal, I can use the dollars I assigned to that category to buy my iMac.

### Roll with the punches
So I dined out more than I allotted this month. That's okay; instead of feeling guilt, I can take some left over dollars I assigned to one thing to cover the overspending in another. Now, this will essentially give me *less* in that category I pulled from to cover the overspending but this is a way to not feel like a failure when you spend too much in one category[^2].

## I gave up too quickly before
I gave up almost after a month of using YNAB before. I admit, the mobile app is confusing if you are just coming to it fresh. I was also still micromanaging my money; if a charge didn't show up immediately, I [reconciled my account](https://www.youneedabudget.com/how-to-reconcile-in-ynab/) more times than I could count instead of letting my dollars do their jobs[^3].

I went back to Mint but *that is just an aggregator of your expenses* and not a *true system for changing your behavior*.

## Back and better than before

I am pretty sure I am sticking with YNAB now for the foreseeable future. I've gotten better at Googling so if I don't know a thing I can Google it or find it on their blog. I love this app and I have told as many people as I could about it.

Give it a shot. It's free for 34 days and $83/yr after that. Nothing to lose.

[^1]: I also couldn't stomach looking at my savings drain with very little coming in.
[^2]: When you feel like you've blown your budget you are more likely to quit. That's why this method is so damn good.
[^3]: Being below the poverty line for large swaths of my adult life means that I am constantly worried about not having enough. I haven't done this in YNAB this time, at least not yet. I am hoping to *not* do it ever again. We'll see.
