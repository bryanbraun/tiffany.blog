This is an updated list of my favorite productivity apps for Mac.

Most of the apps remain the same. I have switched content storage, task managers, and added a podcast player. I also added a content editor.

My <a href="https://thatmacnerd.com/2016/06/06/10-best-productivity-apps-mac/">original list</a> was a long one with some runner-ups. BusyCal got updated and they even added an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/busycal/id1035689743?mt=8">iOS app</a>. I am not going to list out all the apps I did on the other article.

So, here they are.

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://evernote.com/download/">Evernote</a></li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-742" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot2016-08-13_06-30-17_PM-2.png" width="2728" height="1636" />

This is, and has always been, my favorite way to store information. I got on the plain text bandwagon some time last year. While it worked for the most part, I missed Evernote’s flexibility. In the next few posts I will share how I am using Evernote for GTD. Look out for that.

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.busymac.com/busycal/">BusyCal Update</a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-739" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot2016-08-13_06-34-10_PM-2.png" width="2644" height="1501" /></li>
</ul>

It’s a slight improvement. I like the look of this one much better than the skeumorphic BusyCal 2.

<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html">Hemingway Desktop</a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-740" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot2016-08-13_06-32-29_PM-2.png" width="2784" height="1868" /></li>
</ul>

You can use this online for free but I wanted something for the desktop. This helps you write with brevity. I run my blog posts through this now. It costs $10 for the desktop.

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com">PocketCasts Web App</a></li>
</ul>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-741" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot2016-08-12_08-45-29_PM-2.png" width="2556" height="1598" />

I didn’t mention a podcast app in my 10 Best iOS apps post. I was using Overcast because of the Smart Speed feature. It trims silences to speed things up. It also has Volume Boost. I enjoyed Overcast because it was the only app with these features. I was using PocketCasts and preferred its interface over Overcast’s. But Overcast’s major features were enough for me to switch.

PocketCasts 6 adds those features. It also has a attractive web app that costs at one time fee of $9 which I will be paying for Friday. I like listening on the desktop as well, not just my phone. The web app interface makes it a  must-have for me.

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a></li>
</ul>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-738" src="https://thatmacnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot2016-08-13_06-33-18_PM-2.png" width="2728" height="1632" />

I bought into OmniFocus when I first got my Mac. I used it for a long time and found that it was too busy and too complicated for my needs. I didn’t know how to use it right— I didn’t have a solid grasp on GTD. I also needed a few lessons on Defer dates and Due dates, as well as contexts.

Using Todoist was fun and great with the Karma feature. That got old, though, and I missed OmniFocus’s many GTD-specific features.
