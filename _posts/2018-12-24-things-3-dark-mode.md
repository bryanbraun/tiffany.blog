[Things 3 for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?mt=8&uo=4) and [Things 3 for iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&uo=4)
recently got an update which included dark mode.

I am a [big time fan of dark mode](https://thatmacnerd.com/virtues-dark-uis/) on most things. But for Things on the Mac, I was resistant to it for a long time[^1].

But with the iPhone XS Max and OLED screen, the ability to have a true black background was appealing to me as someone who *already* had a preference for dark and black modes.


But what really sold it for me was getting the iPad Pro 2018 and the "bezeless" screen, the liquid retina, as well as True Tone, that is what sold it for me.
