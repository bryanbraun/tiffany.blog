title: Figuring Things Out by Being Honest with Myself

excerpt: I stopped writing here for a month or two. I missed it though. I vowed to just be chill about it; no analytics, just stuff I am passionate about in this community.

Jeff Perry,  writing for Rocket Panda:

> It is much more satisfying for me to comment on the smaller things that I’m comfortable speaking on instead of trying to get my share of the pie with what the rest of the big Apple blogs are commenting on. There are times where I may add my feelings and opinions on something but only when it is something that I am comfortable with. Gone are the days where I try and do some quick research and reading up on something that I know _nothing_ about just so that I can be with the rest of the Apple News cycle. It is great if you enjoy that but I found it to be extraordinarily draining both mentally and emotionally. Chasing that forever-spinning wheel of tech news is not something for me.

This is *exactly* what I am trying to do with this blog now.

I look back at posts like [this one](https://thatmacnerd.net/2016/12/23/end-year-mac-app-roundup-part-2/)[^1] and shudder.

This blog is red because of [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/)[^2]. I tried listicles, in depth coverage, reporting and app reviews not because I enjoyed that process, but because *I felt like I had to have a voice in the Apple Community*, to be *seen* and have that blue checkmark on Twitter for my *Apple journalism*.

It started to [become a chore](https://thatmacnerd.net/2019/04/01/moving-on-for-now/) and, well, *it just wasn't fun anymore*.

I missed it though. I vowed to just be chill about it; no analytics, just stuff I am passionate about in this community.

## Off my soapbox
Jeff is someone I enjoy reading. So is Andy over at [The Dent](https://thedent.net/). So expect some of perspective on things I enjoy and am passionate about rather than imitating someone else.
