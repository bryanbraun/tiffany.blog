If you have been reading my blog for any length of time this year, I have regularly updated it for months until recently.

Things are okay; I need to find employment soon, for a dev job, more than likely. And because of that I’ve been heads down in my studies, using Pitt [^1] and the courses I’ve bought and things like [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

I have been busy writing code for the better part of two months and maintaining a [\#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) [blog](https://medium.com/100-days-of-code) which has also fallen off a bit lately.

So while I have lots of things planned for this and my [other blog](https://tiffanywhite.tech) my focus is on becoming a better programmer.

I have some iOS 11 beta testing goodies in store. I have a few Workflow examples as well.

I’m still here just trying to stay afloat.

[^1]: Done with it for now. Ran out of money and while Pitt is a great school, CS programs are far behind when it comes to marketable technologies.
