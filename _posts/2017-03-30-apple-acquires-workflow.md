I have had *write post about Workflow* in my OmniFocus list for weeks now. Looks like I am too late. Apple has acquired WorkflowHQ.

*Federico Viticci* writing over at *MacStories* on [The Future of Workflow](https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-future-of-workflow/):

&gt; I referred to Workflow as Minecraft for iOS productivity and the modern bicycle for the mind in the past… There's nothing else on iOS like Workflow, which deftly walked the fine line between absurd innovation and Apple rejections with a bold vision and technical prowess.

It’ll be interesting to see where Apple takes this. I am hoping for a happy ending for iOS power users like Viticci, myself, and many others.
