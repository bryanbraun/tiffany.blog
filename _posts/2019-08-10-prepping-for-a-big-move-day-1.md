IKEA is probably one of my favorite places to buy *stylish things*[^1].

Two of my living room floor lights are [HOLMO lights](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70394126/):

So in *this* round of *Things to Buy* I bought two more HOLMO floor lamps, as well as another, slightly more expensive floor lamp so that I can avoid the problem I am having in this apartment; poor lighting.

## First purchases

I've purchased another ALEX Drawer and soon, probably in the beginning of next month, I am going to be purchasing a KARLBY 98" wooden/wood grain tabletop from IKEA to replace this LINNMON tabletop. I'm trying to up my *office space game* by getting a wooden table top, getting *serious* lighting, and cleaning up my cable management, kinda like [MacSparky](https://www.macsparky.com/studio)[^2].

My inspiration for my current setup was Jeremy Siers:

Then he came out last year with something far more dope:

Unless I work at a *Big 5* and buy a house[^3] I am never going to be able to afford this type of setup. But the premise is interesting, and some things I want to replicate.

## Getting a gander at the apartment

This isn't happing until 7 days before I am supposed to move as there is a tenant still there and they will want to clean it up. But I have the IKEA Place app and others to guide me on what I need to buy and where I can place it[^4].

I have pretty much packed away my lab and dumped my ALEX drawers but there is still a ways to go...

[^1]: Scandinavian minimalism is appealing to me and a lot of people though I am not sure why that is.
[^2]: Picking up some Gaffer's Tape as well.
[^3]: Maybe I'll rent one but buying is not something I want to do after 2008. Sorry Financiers.
[^4]: I have a floor plan so I have approximate dimensions.
