{% notice info %}
  FYI: I just purchased the [iPad Wall Mount Disk by Studio Proper](https://www.studioproper.com/products/ipad-wall-mount-disk?variant=12466469601391) after    seeing that you could use super sticky adhesive to mount the disk. I originally thought you could only screw it on. Now, it's just taking this very tightly    stuck iPad off the wall...

The following YouTube video on a _whole HomeKit home_ inspired my own wall-mounted iPad experience.
