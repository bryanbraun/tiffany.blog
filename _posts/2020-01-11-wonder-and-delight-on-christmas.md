  I'm really bad at just sharing my random thoughts on a blog. I see others doing it but I don't think I can. I'm more of a writer in that way.

My mom and I have a long, documented, tumultuous history between us. It's been rough. I won't get into it here but it was bad. Really bad.

There were times people asked me why I didn't just cut her off. I just *couldn't*. She's all I have.

Our relationship is *exponentially* better than it has ever been. So when I got this job, I knew I wanted to give her something. Not the usual something; a gift card to Applebee's or the movies. I have money now, so it was time to *do better*.

*And I did*.

This video makes me smile, quite broadly. If you have or have had a strained relationship with a parent, you get it.

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do[^1].
