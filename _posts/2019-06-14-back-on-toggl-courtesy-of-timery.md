For the longest time I've been tracking my time with [Timing](https://timingapp.com/) which is a time tracking app that tracks you *automatically*; no need to start and stop timers manually. It worked really good for me, in fact, too good: I stopped looking at the data. Why? Because it was too easy for me to set it and forget it. I would forget Timing was running and barely ever *thought* about looking at the data. When I *did*, I found it tracked things I deemed unnecessary. And that is *no bueno*.

## Timing to...Toggl?

I was perfectly happy with Timing, despite my inadequate usage of it. So you'd be correct in guessing I had no reason to look at something else. The issue with macOS utilities like Timing is that an equivalent iOS app *cannot* exist.

*Enter Toggl*.

I used this app [a long time ago](https://thatmacnerd.netlify.com/toggl-and-coachme-for-goals/). I liked it quite a bit however I found that manual time tracking was tedious; I'd always forget to start and stop timers. So I switched over to [Timing](https://thatmacnerd.netlify.com/pick-month-timing-2/) and I've been using it for two years until a couple weeks ago.

How did I decide to make the switch? *Easy*.

## Nerds that convince other nerds...

For weeks nerds on Apple pundit podcasts that I listen to extolled the virtues of a new Toggl client but they didn't have a proper name; the app landing page was pretty bare as well, just a red timer icon.

Everyone was *excited* about this app:

* It's the client Toggl should have made
* This app makes working with Toggl so much better
* Shortcuts support is phenomenal in this app

...and so on.

I really wanted to try this new app. Knowing when it was going to be released wasn't knowledge that most of us *not in the know* had and I wasn't on the beta. To my surprise, it was released a couple weeks ago.

That app is [Timery](https://www.timeryapp.com/).

## First impressions

I really, truly, *like this app*. While I am not sure if I am truly using all its features, I *do* get a lot of use out of it on iOS.

It's easy to start a timer from pretty much *anywhere* in the app which makes starting timers almost *frictionless*.

## Settings

The settings area in Timery is where you'll do most of your project and tags setups. You can also subscribe to Timery Club which is *stupid cheap* at $.99/mo[^1].

## Projects and tags

You can create new projects and tags from the Settings screen. If you have a premium Toggl account you can do even more[^2].

## Dark mode all the things

I love dark mode[^3] but I tend to like white backgrounds for things like this. But Timery has two dark mode...modes? A gray-ish background and a pure black background.

## What about at the Mac?

I use Alfred and [Alfred-Toggl](https://github.com/jason0x43/alfred-toggl) for this while keeping Toggl web app in a [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) desktop wrapper.

Alfred Toggl is *amazing* making starting new timers, editing projects and tags, adding new ones, or continuing a timer super easy.

## So far...

I'm digging it. I don't miss Timing at all really. We'll see how well I keep this up.

[^1]: Yes, another subscription. I've learned to prioritize what I subscribe to and ruthlessly unsubscribe to services and apps if I am not using them. *Looking at you Evernote.*
[^2]: I don't and currently don't see the need as it's just me and I am not running any type of business or in any type of team environment.
[^3]: But I am starting to back off the pure black and some things I still use in light mode.
