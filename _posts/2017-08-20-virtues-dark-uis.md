I never liked dark UIs.

I love white backgrounds; crisp white UIs were [^1] anathema to my dark former Android soul.

All my iPhones and iPads have been silver with white faces. White is chic. You get the idea.

When I was programming in Coda 2 on my Mac when I just started doing it, the UI was white. I showed someone a screenshot of it and they joked, *real programmers use dark editors*.

I couldn’t fathom that. I tried it. I didn’t like it. Not at first. But I added a theme to my editor called [Monokai](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai) and *the color*. The contrast of the colorful fonts and functions, methods, etc, on a dark background hooked me.

## Dark *Everything*

As someone who sits in front of a computer for long periods during the day, I need something that will take the strain off my eyes [^2].

Dark UIs are perfect for this. And as you can see, I have it pretty much *everywhere*.

[^1]: I *still* love crisp white UIs. iOS is a boon to me in this way.
[^2]: I squint. A lot. I attribute that to computer use and age.
