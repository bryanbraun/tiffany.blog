I'm sure that you've seen that I haven't posted here for a couple of months.

In between my internship ending and the abrupt ending of my lease, I have had a pretty stressful couple of months.

*It's been hell actually*.

Long story short, I had to leave Pittsburgh for a bit and move back close to my hometown which really puts me at a disadvantage job wise: this area is technically barren and lags behind current trends, and I am also locked into a year lease.

Luckily for me there are plenty of remote opportunities and a company that asked me to apply to them again once I got more experience in web development.

The internship allowed me to save enough money to move into *my dream place*. It is super nice and super cheap. This place could go for so much more but I am glad it is what it is.

## New Office Space

The internship also allowed me to upgrade my desk/office space:

Rocking dual monitors is key for developer productivity and all the rest is gravy. The monitor isn't pretty but the matte 4k screen is pretty nice.

## Smart Things

I bought a set of LIFX lights and a LIFX LED strip, another Echo but this time an Echo Dot. I am still cleaning things up and putting things together but I am having fun with the *smart home* stuff as evidenced here:

## That's All For Now

It's pretty damn late and I am about to crash. Just wanted to get something up on the blog.
