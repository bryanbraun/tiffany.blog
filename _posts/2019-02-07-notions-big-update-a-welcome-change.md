Technically, this update *isn't* monumental; but it *is* big: the long awaited web clipper is **finally here**.

As far as the desktop: you'll need to download the [Notion Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk).

It works basically the same way as the mobile clipper. You can read more about this update [on Notion's webpage](https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-Web-Clipper-157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c).

## New iPad Pro updates

No more black bars. Yay!

## Split View multitasking

No more using Notion in Chrome as we now have Split View. It has been a *major* sticking point for me ever since I've been using it. *Finally*.

## API on the roadmap

Zapier integration plus opening up an API would make this app *killer*. Also need Shortcuts support. 😉
