So, [I got laid off](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2020/03/04/on-being-laid-off-some-thoughts/). I don't want to get into that here on this blog but you can follow that link to read more about it. I am okay as freelance work has come up that will pay the bills for a couple months and I am pounding the pavement usually daily to find something permanent so that is a relief[^1].

What I *really* want to talk about here is *filmmaking* and how much *I love doing it*, more specifically *editing*[^2].

## Early fun

When I started to get *really into* computers I was doing the online dating thing and would create just random talking videos for the guy I was talking to. I was young but not super young, around 27, 28. I would fire up the webcam and ramble[^3] and would edit them in Windows Movie Maker[^4]. I thoroughly enjoyed editing those videos. I'd make random videos from pictures even, and edit them in WMM. I was, and still am, *a creative* in many ways. Writing was a thing I did really well and thought I'd make a career. But I was below the poverty line and desperate to *get out* so I switched things back up to my first love, tech, and decided I'd learn to code. This turned out to be wise but while it's a cerebral and logical endeavor, the itch to *tell stories* was still there for me. I'd bought cameras before and shot some really lacking photos while I was just learning. I gravitate towards realism and street photography is perhaps my favorite genre though one time I captured a couple drug addicts in Pittsburgh and it didn't go over well[^5].

Still, I wanted to shoot video and tell gritty stories, much like the stories I'd written.

## Bought the gear

I have bought *a metric fuckton of gear* over the past year. I am not saying it is *expensive* or anything like that. It's all relatively inexpensive[^6] and works for now. I'd like to upgrade eventually but for now I need to worry about finding work after this project is finished.

## Some ramblin about gear

I ramble a bit in these videos but I like what I've got; my gear rack is one of my favorite parts of this office/studio.

## The channels?

Yeah I have Tiff Talks Tech - [website](https://tifftalkstech.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWi0HlYe3si17IRc-dauGGg) and Distinguished Fat Loss - [website](https://distinguishedfatloss.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH5G2OXKVR4eflomyDr1qZw?view_as=subscriber).

I am part of the [#nosmallcreator](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nosmallcreator) group on Facebook and it is *wonderful*.

COVID-19 has pretty much put a damper on my filming for a while[^7] but I look forward to getting back to it.


[^1]: Not much of one but it's all I got. 🤷🏾‍♀️
[^2]: Shooting is fun af but let's be real; the creative stuff comes from the editing.
[^3]: Blow kisses and other...things.
[^4]: Whatchu know about WMM? Microsoft's answer to iMovie, I suppose.
[^5]: They heard the shutter; that camera was so damn loud. They turned around, said "uh uh. Delete 'em." They watched me. They told me they were nice about it but one day I'd come across a convict or someone who wouldn't give a fuck and I'd get murked. So I stopped doing street photography entirely.
[^6]: The most expensive things were the camera itself, the [Canon EOS M50](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Camera-EF-M15-45mm-Video/dp/B079Y45KTJ), and my two mid-range gimbals, [Zhiyun Crane-M2 Crane M2 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VG69CN4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and the [DJI Osmo 3 Mobile](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081P8TT74/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) both of which are *fantastic* little gimbals for the price.
[^7]: Getting my tooth fixed is a priorty as well as me finishing the edit to this damn vlog I did three weeks ago...
