*I did it*. I got on the bandwagon and bought some AirPods.

I had them in my cart in the Apple Store app and at B&H Photo Video app for about a year and a half. I ordered them when I was working last year and then cancelled them. I needed to move and couldn't justify the expense as the cost of the movers, upgrading my office, the security deposit, and the truck was *astronomical*[^1].

So I shelved getting them until...

## Tax refund time

I needed some other things throughout last year and this year, the tax refund I got was pretty nice. I bought some things to make my apartment feel more homey and then I got the AirPods.

I really like them. But they aren't a game changer for me. When I sit at the desk I have on my over-the-ear headphones and I am home most of the time. When I do go out it is usually with friends or family and I don't have them on. If I have an appointment they are great as they allow me to not have to wear my bulky Bluetooth over-the-ear headphones.

## Parting thoughts

Pairing is the best part of AirPods. Really great, seamless pairing unlike anything I've yet to experience. This is why they are my Pick of the Month.
