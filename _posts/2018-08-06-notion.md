For about a year now, I have been listening to podcasts and watching YouTube videos[^1] about a productivity app called [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). It is essentially an all-around place for you or your team to have wikis, code specs, tasks, notes, databases, Kanban, calendars, you name it, it has it[^2].

In the following video I explain to you how I'm using it. I didn't use my podcast mic or anything; it was just a spur of the moment *oh I have to tell everyone about this* kind of thing so I apologize for the audio quality.

[^1]: I usually skipped the videos because I had no reason to switch from Evernote. I was afraid I'd be wasting time and adding another subscription.
[^2]: Almost.
