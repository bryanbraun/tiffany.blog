As a developer, I get mad when I see reviews on the App Store complaining about *price*; people don't value software as much as they value drinking coffee or going to get a burger from Five Guys. I get it. I do. But what *I do not appreciate* is when some random person says, *well, no one promised you'd make a living selling software. Sorry*!

No one promised that you should be able to be making a living doing what you're doing either bud so simmer down[^1].

Anyway...

I know developers need to eat and I get *just as angry* when some entitled user feels that they can't spend $5 on an app that either:

1. Saves them time
2. Offers entertainment value
3. Helps them do dope shit

The net positive in relation to the $5 cost is enormous though it definitely depends on usability and design. But for the most well designed apps with thoroughly thought out UX and feature set, $5 is *nothing* if it does any of the three things mentioned above.

Where it gets a bit hairy, and this is the crux of software pricing now, is when *everything is a subscription*.

## Subscriptions for...logging my caffeine intake?

Don't get me wrong; I will always pay for a subscription that does one of the three things above. But when you have similar apps and services doing similar things, or if the app seems like it just *doesn't need a subscription*, it is wise to clamp down and push back.

## My subscription list

This is a Notion database of all my subscriptions:

Take a look at my yearly costs:

***This is outrageous***. ***This is insane***.

I really, really need to think about where to cut the fat; I can *technically* afford this. But I don't want the excess.
