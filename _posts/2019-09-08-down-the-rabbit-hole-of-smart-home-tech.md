It all started innocently enough. Scroll YouTube and find some tech related videos. The algorithm surfaced this:

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F-mEA5RN_yo" ratio="16:9" %}

And then I watched this from the sidebar:

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QuByECkIXZs" ratio="16:9" %}

And then this:

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6z24f_3rmQw" ratio="16:9" %}

And the rest, is well...

## Bitten by the YouTube algorithm

You gotta hand it to Google for their clever[^1] algorithm-foo. I'm not complaining though; I'm a technophile through and through. All of this intrigued me as I had already started smart home stuff when I moved here last year.

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v2UZEEOFSlQ" ratio="16:9" %}

Now that I've dipped my toe into the proverbial smart home waters, I decided to *binge watch all the smart home videos on YouTube*[^2].

The result is...all of this...

## The purpose

I love tech, I love cool shit, and this allows me to do cool shit with the tech I have. Some of the videos I've watched have me slack-jawed in awe.

As for the cameras: I have *a lot* of expensive tech. And the last apartment I lived in was so bad, I mean, criminals, dealers, felons, everywhere, I have become increasingly paranoid after leaving that place. Now, this place is *so much better* and the next is a affordable luxury apartment, so I shouldn't have to worry about any of this. But *I can't help it*; it's ingrained in me to the point where I couldn't walk to the laundry room when I first moved here, which is right down the hall. The effects of poverty are immense and not to be discussed in this post. But I learned most of my life that people will take what is not theirs without giving a flying f*ck about it.

I have a lot of expensive things I have bought over the years and much more in the past two years. I don't want to lose it. So I have the camera, [‎Home Inventory Mac App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-inventory/id413564952?mt=12), and great renter's insurance.

## More to come

I am doing the whole vlog thing and will probably put it up on YouTube or Vimeo, not sure yet. I just want to chronicle this whole journey in any form I can, not for posterity per se but just for *me*.
