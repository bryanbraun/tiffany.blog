After [watching this video on using Trello for an editorial calendar](https://youtu.be/\_YeUmaC9-6A) , I was pretty excited to start doing so for my two main blogs.

Creating and editing Trello cards and lists is a tedious process on iOS and if an idea popped into my head, I wanted to be able to get it down quickly and into Trello.

## Drafts

I knew that [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quick-capture/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001lnT5) was the quickest way to jot something down on iOS. I also understood that I could easily [find a few actions](http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search_type=actions&amp;q=Trello&amp;button=) that could help me accomplish this quickly.

## Configuration

Configuration is a bit of a step. You’ll have to find your board and list’s ids by exporting the board in question to JSON. You can do this by setting something like this:

`https://trello.com/b/[board_shortlink]/myBoard.json`

And searching through the long list of dictionary items to find the exact ones you need. This is cumbersome but there isn’t a better way to do so currently, unless you plan on developing an app that interfaces with Trello.

## Executing

If you have boards set up like this one for instance:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2326 size-large" src=" 

You can then start adding cards to lists in your preferred board.

## Easiest Way to Use Trello?

That’s debatable. But now with the [Trello Mac app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trello/id1278508951?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001lnT5) things are looking mighty good for Trello users.
