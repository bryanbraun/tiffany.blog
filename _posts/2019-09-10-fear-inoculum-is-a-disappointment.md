The sprawling soundscapes, lazy songwriting, and just all around TOOL feeling like they were uninterested in making this album, made for a poor listening experience. It was, is, a TOOL album[^1], but *not* a TOOL album.

I listened to the first track, which was good enough. But as the album went on, I wasn't moved by it like I am by most of TOOL's songs. I waited, TOOL fans waited, for *13 years* and this album should have been much better in relation to the time it took to make it. It wasn't. But I'll share it here for you to listen to.
