Good E-reader reports that Apple News partner, The Guardian, is pulling its news site from the app [^1].

[From Good E-reader](http://goodereader.com/blog/digital-publishing/the-guardian-is-no-longer-including-articles-on-apple-news-or-facebook):

&gt; We have run extensive trials on Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News to assess how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives....we have decided to stop publishing in those formats on both platforms. Our primary objective is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of the Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism

This isn't necessarily a death knell for Apple's ambitions for News, but it doesn't look good. More publishers are having trouble extracting analytics and getting revenue from the service.

It will be interesting to see how many more news sites remove their content from Apple News.

[^1]: To be fair, it is also pulling the paper from Facebook Instant Articles.
