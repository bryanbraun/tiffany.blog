I was browsing the<a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/"> MobileRead forums</a> like I do [^1] and visited the [Amazon Echo thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=253924). I usually avoid this thread because I am really waiting until I finally get a developer job to make my apartment [^2] more “high tech” and the Echo was on my Amazon wishlist for later, when I can afford the luxury.

But while I was browsing MobileRead on my iPad [^3], I saw a photo of some of the weird syntax it uses, as well as some weird Siri nonsense and I was intrigued. I went to the thread and found that QVC was selling **new** Echos for *$75*. Along with that, you get two free months of Amazon Music and Audible [^4].

## Well, Things Changed Quickly

I decided I’d send the link to my mother who uses QVC and buys pretty much everything from there. We just had a conversation about her not buying from there in a year and I send her the link. She laughed but she bought it for me as a Xmas gift [^5]. $75 isn’t a bad price for the Echo at all and the fact that they are new is nice.

## More IFTTT Recipes? Yes, Please.

I only have a couple in anticipation for the Echo…

[^1]: While there are things like Slack and Gitter, old school BBS forums like MobileRead and iMore are my favorite for synchronous chat interactions. Plus I am a *total* book nerd.
[^2]: I will be moving once I do get a dev job. Terribly far out from town. Being closer helps the commute.
[^3]: I use [Tapatalk Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapatalk-100-000-forums-worldwide/id307880732?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001lnT5).
[^4]: New accounts only. They are also third party codes so YMMV.

[^5]: Instead of another winter coat, which she buys me every year, of which I have three or four that fit just fine.
