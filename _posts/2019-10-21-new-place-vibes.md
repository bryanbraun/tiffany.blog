I moved into my new place almost a month ago. It is taking some getting used to; new tax bracket, new, "better", neighborhood, *unabashedly quiet neighbors*, and the *perks* of being surrounded by bushes and trees...[^1].

What I want to talk about is that what is considered *better* just may not be.

## Better in what context?

I have lived in broken down, poor neighborhoods since I stepped out on my own 18 years ago. Not all of them I was fond of. But the last one, the one I moved to last year when coming back here from Pittsburgh, *that one* was magnificent.

In these types of environments, you get used to the loudness of the voices, the blaring music on a Friday night after someone gets off of work at their grueling 9-5, the smokers hanging outside texting on their cheap smartphones. This gives these places *life*; these places are living, breathing, manifestations of humanity, of struggle and triumph, of just people doing their best to get by.

I spent the last 18 years of my life trying to get by, going hungry most nights[^2], taking out school loans so I could pay my rent, buy computers to code on, and eat.

I've been disabled my entire life, with what I will not discuss. But getting a check every month is some type of stability and most of us in those neighborhoods scraped by but we could *still* count on that check, even if it wasn't enough to live on. I felt *home* there. It was what I was used to. I was a young person when I moved out on my own, barely in my 20s. That life was all I'd ever known from my 20s until this year.

And while I grew up in a middle class family with upper middle-class extended family, *I* didn't benefit from any of that for more reasons I will not talk about here.

People talk about some place being *ghetto* or you live *in the hood* but the people who say these things have never had to live off $10,000 a year[^3] and have no idea about *why* the places they are disparaging *are the way they are*.

Not being *ghetto* or *hood* is *better*. Not to me. Those folks were *real af*. And I miss them.

## Taking in the new reality

The new reality for me is I am in a quiet neighborhood of affordable luxury apartments with homes I can aspire to rent with a couple raises[^4].

I have more money than all my local friends.

I have more money than some of my family.

I finally have savings.

I can actually eat well and exercise.

I can afford to buy a new iPhone and Apple Watch.

I make enough money that next year my tax refund will be the largest I've ever received and I will probably buy an iMac Pro.

This is all so unreal. Still.

*I wouldn't trade those things for all the fame and notoriety in the world.*

## Setting up

Just a random video I took.

[^1]: Not for about a week now, but I've killed: beetles, crickets, *big ass spiders that should not be so hard and fast and should also not exist my god*, three stinkbugs, and a moth. Lots of these things. The baseboards in the living area are not flush with the hardwood so I am buying [Ortho Home Defense](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7KSXHX?tag=amz-mkt-chr-us-20&ascsubtag=1ba00-01000-a0042-mac00-other-nomod-us000-pcomp-feature-scomp-wm-5&ref=aa_scomp).
[^2]: I used to have to conserve every bit of food. I still have this mindset. It is difficult to realize you can go to the store tomorrow if you need more food because you have savings and money in the bank.
[^3]: That's all I had last year.
[^4]: $1700/mo. Lulz
