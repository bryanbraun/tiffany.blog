The amount of times I have thought about killing myself this year is a non-zero number. In fact, I can count it on one hand, all five fingers, which is too much, for any year, for any life.

When I got laid off, I immediately searched for how to acquire a gun, which guns would blow my brains out and not just half my face off while keeping me alive. I was institutionalized at a young age, around 20, after spending time in and out of psych wards and group homes as a young teenager. In that hospital, there was a man who tried to blow his brains out but didn't kill himself, just blew half his face off. Half his head was indented in, he only had a small, consistent hole in his head where his mouth was, and skin grafted over the part of his head that they tried to reconstruct. He had to eat pureed food, drink through a straw, and smoke cigarettes out of that hole. That's a cruel thing to do to someone, and seeing that, I didn't want that to happen to me. So I kept searching.

Searching for:
- How to blow your brains out with a shotgun
- Will a pistol do enough damage to blow your brains out
- How to position a gun to blow your brains out and not just your face off

And on it went. So much so Google offered a suicide hotline number every time I searched.

This went on for weeks.

Then, I decided to see if the medicine I take to keep my depression and other things at bay would kill me.

No such luck.

At this point, I had savings but unemployment denied me. My rent is astronomical. I didn't know what the fuck I was gonna do.

I spent nights awake. I'd get up thinking I still had a job only to remember I'd been let go.

What made this whole thing worse for me is where I came from.

## Abject poverty is a thing
No, I didn't grow up poor. Mom and I were firmly lower middle-class, when lower middle class was a thing and not just middle class as a whole.

I didn't really hurt for anything as mom didn't let me know if we were hurting or not. Sure, we ate canned veggies and Rice-a-Roni but that was because my mom can't really cook, at least that's what I told myself.

All of my family is upper-middle class[^1], bougie af. So when I became sick, there was tension. I had to receive treatment. And as I got worse and was sent off at 16, I needed my own money. I got SSI, Supplemental Security Income, which in the late 90s, was $30/mo because all my other expenses were taken care of by the state. I got $15 every two weeks.

I smoked. So did everyone else. None of us had enough money. Sure, you could work. You could do piece meal work where some company commissions the group home to have us kids put little pieces of electronics in a tube for $.01/hr. I got a paycheck once for $.34!

Moving out of those places and finally being on my own[^2] I got more money. But definitely not much.

You go into public housing and subsidized housing and you have no goddamn money. It is like, "okay, do I pay my electric or put food on the table?"

This was a thing my entire adult life.

My boyfriend and I, when I was 26, eating icee pops because fuck me, payday isn't for another two weeks and the freezer is bare. Taking tobacco out of cigarette butts in his ashtray and rolling it up in loose leaf paper I had from school and smoking it because hey, cigarettes are expensive and so are cigrar papers.

So imagine, after years and years of this, you fight and claw your way out after learning to code. You are middle-class after 15+ years of going to food banks and thinking about selling whatever drugs you and your friends were doing at that time, just so you wouldn't go fucking hungry.

I could tell y'all stories *mannnnnn*.

## Money in money out
I was making decent money, moved to the suburbs. Life was good!

But by the time November of 2019 rolls around, I felt like things were taking a turn. And in February I was part of a bunch of layoffs and now was in dire straits. You get some freelance work, unemployment kicks in, but that shit doesn't last forever.

## Suicide is painless
I have been trying to gain employment all year, in the middle of a fucking pandemic and this shit is hard. I definitely have continued to think about ways to get out of this situation. And lots of times, too many, I was *this close* to doing it.

My mom went in for knee surgery, came out, and now is sick and frail. She is also suffering from the beginnings of dementia and it is like fuck.

I am working through a life of unending trauma in therapy, in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, with a frail and increasingly forgetful mother, with no job and unemployment running out.

I am pretty. Well, I was lying in bed last night and thought, *there is a part of me that is dead. I feel a part of my insides rotting from necrosis. I don't know if it will ever become alive again.*

That's the crux of it all.

## Here, trying my best.
I am writing this and damn near crying. I started writing some of it in second person; I tend to do that when trying not to feel emotional about what I am writing but I decided to not do it that way and now I am kinda regretting it.

I am doing what I can. My therapist and I have safety plans and whatever in place. I am applying to jobs again. But to be honest, I am just... *tired* and want this to end.
