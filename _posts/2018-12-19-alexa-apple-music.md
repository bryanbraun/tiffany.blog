# Apple Heavily Promotes the Amazon Echo’s Apple Music Integration – MacStories

*John Voorhees, writing for MacStories*:

> Today, Apple began promoting Apple Music’s availability on Echo devices through three different channels. The Echo integration first appeared on the App Store, which gave the Alexa app top billing in a Today tab story that highlights the new feature. Apple is also promoting the Echo integration on the Apple Music features page of its website along with other third-party devices like PCs, Android devices, and Sonos music players. Finally, late in the day US time, the Apple Music app began delivering push notifications highlighting the Echo feature.

Apple *needs* these integrations as growth from their cash cow, the iPhone slows. The question is how far are they willing to open up the umbrella?
