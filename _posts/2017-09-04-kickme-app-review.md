*Thanks to Alif Aleph Sajan for letting me test [KickMe](http://www.kickmeapp.com)*.

KickMe is a cross-platform app built using a Node framework called Electron which allows a developer to write one app and port it to Windows, Mac, and Linux.

For a video overview of the app, check the YouTube video below.

## The Good

This is a really interesting concept. I too often have windows upon windows snapped in different locations using BetterSnapTool as well as multiple desktops.

As the video showed, you can activate KickMe with ⌘⌥K or when the app is in your dock, you can tap the icon provided you have a trackpad or Magic Mouse [^1].

Kicks are tasks. You can have projects that hold your Kicks, etc. It is novel, and I appreciate a developer trying interesting ways to help people be more productive.

## The Bad

I am not really using it. I am having a hard time finding where it fits in my workflow. I currently have OmniFocus, Evernote, and Fantastical doing the heavy lifting for my productivity [^2]. While being able to rinse the screen of distractions is handy, I can do that with ⌥⌘H in OmniFocus or Evernote when I want to concentrate. It basically hides all your other windows so you can focus. But I can do that without this app.

And as I showed before, I have multiple desktops to help me with what programmers call, “the separation of concerns”, which is self-explanatory.

## Good For Normals

If you are someone who doesn’t fiddle too much with expensive productivity apps and doesn’t dig much into your app’s menus, then this will be a great option to manage your tasks, your most important tasks, and being able to focus *solely* on those tasks. But for me, OmniFocus and its Perspectives and the Hide All menu option is easier and has more of my muscle memory.

## Where You Can Find the App

You can find KickMe [on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickme/id1237641964?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001lnT5)

[^1]: That’s how I initially did it because the website indicated that’s how you were to do it.
[^2]: nvAlt as well for quick notes.
