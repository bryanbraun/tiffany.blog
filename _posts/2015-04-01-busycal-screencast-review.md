As promised, here is my screencast review of BusyCal. There are a few around but people seem to be in love with Fantastical 2 since it has just been released. It’s receiving high praise so I’ll test it out and report back. I don’t plan on buying <em>another</em> calendar replacement app, but I will utilize the free trial.

In any case, here is the BusyCal screencast.

You can buy BusyCal <a href="http://www.busymac.com/store/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

<strong>Note:</strong>
Learning more about screencasting as I go. The quality is okay but I should have bumped the quality up past 1206 kbits/s. So now I know.
