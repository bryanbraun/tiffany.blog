*[From Google’s Material Design for iOS FAQ](https://material.io/develop/ios/docs/faq/)*:
<blockquote><strong>We don’t want our iOS app to stand out as looking like a Google app.</strong></blockquote>



<blockquote>Google’s own use of Material Design is customized to give the experience of a “Google app.” Your use of Material Design should provide an experience unique to your brand and identity.</blockquote>


I’m not sure what the play is here for Google but while I like Material Design, I am not sure that *look* really belongs on iOS.

We’ll see what developers do with it.
