This past week I picked up the [Nanoleaf Rhythm Smarter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Nanoleaf-Rhythm-Smarter-Kit-Pack/dp/B079HD9JWH) on Amazon to *almost* round out what I want my office/studio to look like.

I was skeptical; the reviews were mixed. People complained about how flimsy the connectors were, that they were hard to put up, and that they didn't stick to the wall real well.

So far, I have experienced *none of that*.

They are bright, beautiful, and fun

Check them out below.
