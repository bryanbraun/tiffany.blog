I am a nerd. I am sure everyone who reads this blog[^1] is a nerd of some sort.

As such, I traipse around the internet looking for Mac setups and desktop screenshots.

I found a Reddit thread on the r/MacSetups subsreddit and the setup that was posted was *absolutely fantastic*. Beautiful, clean, large, tech-y.

On his desktops were what seemed to be overlays or widgets. Someone asked him what they were and he mentioned [Übersicht Widgets](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/), which I clicked on and found what are some decent widgets.

I tried [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/v2/geektool/) but found it archaic and hard to setup. Übersicht is far easier, and all the code for the widgets are hosted on GitHub.

## My Widgets

- [Network Throughput](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#ubersicht-network-throughput)
- [Authentic Weather](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#authentic-weather)[^2]
- [GitHub Notifications](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#github-notifications)
- [Git Log](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#git-log)

There are more but it is a bit of a pain to list them. The Übersicht widget site doesn't have a search mechanism and some of them I found just randomly searching GitHub. When in doubt, search GitHub or just scroll through the website and filter by *name*, *downloads*, or *date*.

## My Desktops

What do my desktops look like?
