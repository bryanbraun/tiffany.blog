  I wanted to write a quick post on the focus of the blog going forward.
  Last year, I was inspired by a few of my productivity heroes to write about productivity instead of just apps. I thought it was a perfect opportunity to expand my reach and grow the blog beyond what it had become.

I wanted to write a quick post on the focus of the blog going forward.

Last year, I was inspired by a few of my productivity heroes to write about productivity instead of just apps. I thought it was a perfect opportunity to expand my reach and grow the blog beyond what it had become.

Putting widgets, Facebook Page Like buttons, and having email sign-ups all seemed like a good idea to me. Seeing as I was just starting out, I thought it would extend my reach and become a place where people could go to learn tips and tricks from me and a few of my friends in the productivity space.

While it has done great things for the blog [^1] I have struggled to write consistently about productivity as my systems shift quite often.

I have also been watching my favorite indie Apple blogs and some of the big players and have decided that I need to get back to my roots: *writing about apps and workflows using those apps*.

## Productivity is a Convoluted Space

There are a lot of productivity guru sites out there and I follow some of them. It is a hard place to get noticed if you aren't selling and I am a bit uncomfortable with that aspect of the industry. Growing my audience organically and sharing my articles on Facebook and in groups will help me get the audience I desire, and thus, I can start monetizing the site some other way that doesn't include courses.

Federico Vittici grew MacStories in a manner I admire, though I really don't think I'd want to make a full fledged business out of writing about Apple.

But he did it when he lost his job [^2] and threw his savings into it and came up with one of the go-to sites on Apple on the internet.

That's where I started: apps, Apple news, and workflows.

I am returning to that model for the foreseeable future.

## Taking Cues from My Favorite Apple Sites

As you have probably noticed, I have added *Sections* to the site in the main navigation area. This is taking a cue from [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) only I don't have a developer working with me on the site and so I have tried to work on the PHP backend a bit and added a few plugins to achieve this.

I am also working on a night mode for site.

I have stripped widgets from the footer. For archives I have a dedicated *Archive* page in the navigation.

For all my GTD posts and pages, I have a dedicated *GTD Resources* in the navigation where you can find the pages dedicated to sharing tools/apps and books I have read and used for GTD.

## Sections

There are 7 sections. They are:

- App Reviews
- The Apple Experience [^3]
- Mac Automation
- iOS Automation
- Working on iPad
- News [^4]
- Pick of the Month [^5]

Most of these are self explanatory but those that are not there is a footnote beside them, as you have seen.

The *Working on iPad* section is where I try to move some of my writing, reading, and programming workflows to iPad and report back to you. I am still fleshing this out but it should be a fun exercise in pushing my iPad Pro 12.9" to its limits.

## Any Productivity Posts at All?

Most likely some. But not as the main focus of the site and very few articles posted about GTD and digital decluttering, etc. I will still post them occasionally.

This is the direction for That Mac Nerd. Hope you stick around. I have more content and reviews coming up.

[^1]: Having [my setup featured on The Sweet Setup also helped](http://thesweetsetup.com/tiffany-whites-mac-ios-setup/). A lot.
[^2]: I am looking for employment, not actively pursuing, but will need to start looking after next semester. So I understand the need to just do *something*.
[^3]: Stories about my experience with Apple, its hardware and services, and apps I have used and were delightful, or not so delightful.
[^4]: News on Apple and its app ecosystem.
[^5]: Every month I will review something I have bought, an app, a piece of kit, or something else interesting that I may want to write about. Nod to [Tim Nahumck](https://nahumck.me/category/piques-of-the-week/) for this idea.
