*I got a new gig!* I am a frontend developer at a great company and with this brings *a lot* of changes for me.

I don't know how many of you have been reading this blog for any length of time but I've been searching for work since my last gig ended last year. And now I'm here. *Finally*.

## Using an app to help you plan to uproot your life...again

I just moved here a little over a year ago and now because of *reasons* I'll have to move again. I will also have more money and therefore can get a better apartment[^1] and fill it with good furniture, and put some money away[^2].

I am using Notion to try to plan this enormous life change. I am also using Things but Notion handles this type of thing better.

I created a YouTube video about how I am using Notion to do this. Find it below.
