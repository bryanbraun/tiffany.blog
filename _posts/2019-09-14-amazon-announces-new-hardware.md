Chaim Gartenberg, writing for *The Verge*:

> Details are slim, with the company only promising that it’ll “share some new things from the Amazon Devices and Services team,” but if past years are any indication, expect a whole pile of Amazon Echo and Amazon Fire TV-related hardware announcements — along with a possible surprise or two.

I just bought *3 new Echos* last month.

*Goddamn it*.
