[from Jeff Perry Blog](https://jeffperry.blog/2019/11/01/im-blogging-daily-during-november/) linking to [Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/2019/11/blogging-daily-november/):
> Starting today — Friday, November 1 — I’ll be writing and publishing something every day for the whole month of November.

> Though, instead of writing a novel in a month, I will be simply be focused on publishing something — anything — every single day. From photos, links to interesting things, articles, reviews, etc.

Well this is [NaNoWriMo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month) or National Novel Writing Month where novelists write 50,000 words[^1] in one month.

I no longer write fiction so the idea of writing a blog post everyday for a month[^2] is appealing.

So I declare today NaNoBlogMo. Or something.
