Most of the people reviewing Smart Home gear have some gear list on their websites. Mine will be no different.

## Smart Home Gear

- [SmartThings Hub](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Generation-GP-U999SJVLGDA-Automation/dp/B07FJGGWJL)
  - This is the main way I automate a lot of the stuff around my apartment. Once I get the channel and blog up and running, we will be taking a look at [webCoRE](https://www.webcore.co/).
- [Logitech Harmony Hub](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/harmony-hub)
  - This is the center of my entertainment. You can impress your guests with a premium viewing experience when paired with your Echo, some lighting, and your voice.
- [LIFX A19 Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Adjustable-Multicolor-Dimmable-Assistant/dp/B01KY02MS8)
  - I have these all over my apartment and **I love them**.
- [LIFX A19 Mini Day and Dusk White Wi-Fi Smart LED Light Bulb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Y58D3L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I've moved most of my bulbs to use multi-platform assistants. HomeKit is still not widely available so LIFX remains a staple in my apartment.
- [Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen](https://www.amazon.com/echo-dot-3rd-gen/s?k=echo+dot+3rd+gen)
  - I have two of these, one in my office and one in my master bathroom.
- [Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Previous Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-White/dp/B015TJD0Y4/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=echo%2Bdot%2B2nd%2Bgen%2Bblack&qid=1582430545&sr=8-4&th=1)
  - Use this in my office bathroom.
- [Amazon Echo 2nd Gen](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/dp/B077SXWSRP)
  - I use this as my main smart home speaker.
- [Apple HomePod, White](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/white)
  - Office stereo and shortcuts runner.
- [SmartThings Motion Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-GP-U999SJVLBAA-Optional-Automated/dp/B07F8ZHBLS)
  - This is an amazing little motion sensor I use in my office that connects to the SmartThings hub where you can automate *all kinds of things*.
- [SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/smartthings-multipurpose-sensor/s?k=smartthings+multipurpose+sensor)
  - I have one on my front door and one on my patio door.

  - Random motion and multipurpose sensors for my windows and master bathroom.
- [Wyze Cam Pan](https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-pan/)
  - I have this in my hallway.
- [Samsung SmartThings Outlet](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Outlet-GP-U999SJVLDAA-Smart/dp/B07PNQX2RZ)
  - Recommended by [Smart Home Solver](https://smarthomesolver.com/reviews/39-smartthings-ideas/) and something I am trying to find a use for[^1].
- [Sonos One Gen 2 White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJQFL4X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - This is a nice speaker for my bedroom but it doesn't have much in the way of automation abilities.
- [Aotnex for Wyze Cam Pan Outlet Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/Aotnex-Outlet-Upgraded-Bracket-Without/dp/B07KHS2JR6)
- [The Dot Genie Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/Dot-Genie-Original-Muffled-Designed/dp/B07JQX1XGY)
- [Tabletop Bulb Base](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CBTKRXW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I have this sitting on my bookshelf in my office and I love the way it looks. Thanks Smart Home Solver!
- [LIFX Z LED Strip](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Changing-Dimmable-Assistant-Microsoft/dp/B073168F4Y)
  - I love this little strip.
- [Nanoleaf Rhythm](https://www.amazon.com/Nanoleaf-Rhythm-Smarter-Kit-Pack/dp/B079HD9JWH)
  - Got it and it's *awesome*.
- [Wemo Mini Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NBI0A6R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- [VOCOlinc Smart Wi-Fi LED Light Strip (Starter Kit)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNNW1Y6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Again, HomeKit! I have these under my cabinets and automate them with a SmartThings Motion sensor in my kitchen entryway.
- [Refurbished: Apple iPad Pro 12.9 (1st Gen.) 128GB](https://www.newegg.com/p/0EJ-001B-009D5?&quicklink=true)
  - I mounted this in my entryway for quick-hitter automations.
- [PROPER iPad Pro Case (12.9")](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076RWLVZY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I mount my iPad to the wall in this case
- [PROPER X Lock Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076RT4WN3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I have two of these, one black, one white for my two mounted iPads.
- [Refurbished: Apple iPad Air 2 Silver](https://www.newegg.com/p/0EJ-001B-006E0)
  - I have my mom's old iPad Air 2 mounted in my kitchen for recipes and small automations instead of buying an Echo Show and sitting it on the counter.
- [PROPER X Lock Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076RL1YY5?tag=kitco079-20)
  - This holds my iPad Air 2 in the kitchen on the Proper X Wall Mount.
- [Roborock S5 Robot Vacuum and Mop](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0792BWMV4?tag=kitco079-20)
    - I have a two bedroom apartment on one floor and this is perfect for that. I set it to run every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and couldn't be happier. I've also set it up with the Echo so that I can use my voice to start the vacuum. Easy peasy.
- [Eve Door & Window - Wireless Contact Sensor with Apple HomeKit Technology](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BDM47S2?tag=kitco079-20)
    - Getting more and more into HomeKit. Lately, I've been using SmartThings for more complex automations and nothing else.
- [Koogeek WiFi Plug Smart Outlet Compatible with Alexa, Apple HomeKit and Google Assistant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTKYTTD?tag=kitco079-20)
    - Another plug that works with HomeKit.
- [eufy Security 2K Indoor Cam Pan & Tilt, Plug-in Security Indoor Camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0856W45VL?tag=kitco079-20)
    - More of my HomeKit initiative, this camera has some issues with iOS 14 Home app. I like it a lot though.
- [HomePod - Space Gray](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/space-gray)
    - I have two of these as smart speakers for my living room Apple TV. I have 4 HomePods in total, which, I know. It's ridiculous.
- [Fire TV Stick 4K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QHML21?tag=kitco079-20)
    - This is for the TV being mounted to my bedroom wall tomorrow, August 7th, 2020.
- [Eve Room - Indoor Air Quality Monitor for tracking VOC, temperature & humidity with Apple HomeKit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GKVBYKV?tag=kitco079-20)
    - As someone with really bad allergies, this is a great little utility that I am able to automate with HomeKit. It works for apartments, as renters can't put Nests or Ecobee thermostats in their apartments.
- [ASAKUKI Smart Wi-Fi Essential Oil Diffuser, App Control Compatible with Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C2H2N67/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - I bought a few diffusers to hook up to a couple smart plugs but unfortunately those diffusers need a physical power-on. I bought these more expensive diffusers to make the rooms in my apartment smell great and even better than that, *automated*.
- [VOCOlinc HomeKit Smart Power Strip Multi Outlet Surge Protector Works with Alexa and Google Assistant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083NFNN99/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - I wanted a way to automate turning on the studio lights whenever I record a video. 😉 This was an idea I got from [Eric Welander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thKxeM8zYqY), one of my favorite smart home YouTube creators. Check out his channel if you're into HomeKit.
- [Ring Alarm 5-piece kit (2nd Gen) – home security system](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZDTXJ93/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - As things start adding up in here, and with crime picking up as many people are struggling[^2], I felt increasingly paranoid about the safety of myself and my belongings. I live in the suburbs within a high crime city. I felt like I needed *something*.
- [TP-Link Deco Mesh WiFi System(Deco M5) –Up to 3,800 sq. 2-pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797D6853/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - Since moving here I have had constant dropouts on my network, despite gigabit speeds. I was also not getting the speeds advertised to me with the ISP's router. I decided to get a mesh system as I have 45 or more devices connected to my network and it has been great so far; faster network speeds, and more.
These are just some of the things I'll be reviewing over the next year.

My biggest inspiration for starting this channel, blog, and the like is [Smart Home Solver's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwOBG77Tm8cE24FPxHb_abw). I've devoured all of their content. For starters, check out Reed's Smart Office.


Pretty rad.

[^2]: It's also near the holidays which always sees an uptick in crime.
