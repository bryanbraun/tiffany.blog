Most of the people reviewing Smart Home gear have some gear list on their websites. Mine will be no different.

## Smart Home Gear

- [SmartThings Hub](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Generation-GP-U999SJVLGDA-Automation/dp/B07FJGGWJL)
  - This is the main way I automate a lot of the stuff around my apartment. Once I get the channel and blog up and running, we will be taking a look at [webCoRE](https://www.webcore.co/).
- [Logitech Harmony Hub](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/harmony-hub)
  - This is the center of my entertainment. You can impress your guests with a premium viewing experience when paired with your Echo, some lighting, and your voice.
- [LIFX A19 Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Adjustable-Multicolor-Dimmable-Assistant/dp/B01KY02MS8)
  - I have these all over my apartment and **I love them**.
- [LIFX A19 Mini Day and Dusk White Wi-Fi Smart LED Light Bulb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Y58D3L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I've moved most of my bulbs to use multi-platform assistants. HomeKit is still not widely available so LIFX remains a staple in my apartment.
- [Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen](https://www.amazon.com/echo-dot-3rd-gen/s?k=echo+dot+3rd+gen)
  - I have two of these, one in my office and one in my master bathroom.
- [Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Previous Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-White/dp/B015TJD0Y4/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=echo%2Bdot%2B2nd%2Bgen%2Bblack&qid=1582430545&sr=8-4&th=1)
  - Use this in my office bathroom.
- [Amazon Echo 2nd Gen](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/dp/B077SXWSRP)
  - I use this as my main smart home speaker.
- [Apple HomePod, White](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/white)
  - Office stereo and shortcuts runner.
- [SmartThings Motion Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-GP-U999SJVLBAA-Optional-Automated/dp/B07F8ZHBLS)
  - This is an amazing little motion sensor I use in my office that connects to the SmartThings hub where you can automate *all kinds of things*.
- [SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/smartthings-multipurpose-sensor/s?k=smartthings+multipurpose+sensor)
  - I have one on my front door and one on my patio door.
- [Wyze Sense Starter Kit](https://wyze.com/wyze-sense/)
  - Random motion and multipurpose sensors for my windows and master bathroom.
- [Wyze Cam Pan](https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-pan/)
  - I have this in my hallway.
- [Samsung SmartThings Outlet](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Outlet-GP-U999SJVLDAA-Smart/dp/B07PNQX2RZ)
  - Recommended by [Smart Home Solver](https://smarthomesolver.com/reviews/39-smartthings-ideas/) and something I am trying to find a use for[^1].
- [Sonos One Gen 2 White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJQFL4X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - This is a nice speaker for my bedroom but it doesn't have much in the way of automation abilities.
- [Aotnex for Wyze Cam Pan Outlet Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/Aotnex-Outlet-Upgraded-Bracket-Without/dp/B07KHS2JR6)
- [The Dot Genie Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/Dot-Genie-Original-Muffled-Designed/dp/B07JQX1XGY)
- [Tabletop Bulb Base](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CBTKRXW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I have this sitting on my bookshelf in my office and I love the way it looks. Thanks Smart Home Solver!
- [LIFX Z LED Strip](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Changing-Dimmable-Assistant-Microsoft/dp/B073168F4Y)
  - I love this little strip.
- [Nanoleaf Rhythm](https://www.amazon.com/Nanoleaf-Rhythm-Smarter-Kit-Pack/dp/B079HD9JWH)
  - Got it and it's *awesome*.
- [Wemo Mini Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NBI0A6R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Another set of HomeKit compatible devices strewn about my apartment. Just recently bought one for the office to automate my office fan.
- [VOCOlinc Smart Wi-Fi LED Light Strip (Starter Kit)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNNW1Y6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Again, HomeKit! I have these under my cabinets and automate them with a SmartThings Motion sensor in my kitchen entryway.
- [Refurbished: Apple iPad Pro 12.9 (1st Gen.) 128GB](https://www.newegg.com/p/0EJ-001B-009D5?&quicklink=true)
  - I mounted this in my entryway for quick-hitter automations.
- [PROPER iPad Pro Case (12.9")](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076RWLVZY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I mount my iPad to the wall in this case
- [PROPER X Lock Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076RT4WN3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I have two of these, one black, one white for my two mounted iPads.
- [Refurbished: Apple iPad Air 2 Silver](https://www.newegg.com/p/0EJ-001B-006E0)
  - I have my mom's old iPad Air 2 mounted in my kitchen for recipes and small automations instead of buying an Echo Show and sitting it on the counter.
- [PROPER X Lock Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076RL1YY5?tag=kitco079-20)
  - This holds my iPad Air 2 in the kitchen on the Proper X Wall Mount.
- [Roborock S5 Robot Vacuum and Mop](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0792BWMV4?tag=kitco079-20)
    - I have a two bedroom apartment on one floor and this is perfect for that. I set it to run every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and couldn't be happier. I've also set it up with the Echo so that I can use my voice to start the vacuum. Easy peasy.
- [Eve Door & Window - Wireless Contact Sensor with Apple HomeKit Technology](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BDM47S2?tag=kitco079-20)
    - Getting more and more into HomeKit. Lately, I've been using SmartThings for more complex automations and nothing else.
- [Koogeek WiFi Plug Smart Outlet Compatible with Alexa, Apple HomeKit and Google Assistant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTKYTTD?tag=kitco079-20)
    - Another plug that works with HomeKit.
- [eufy Security 2K Indoor Cam Pan & Tilt, Plug-in Security Indoor Camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0856W45VL?tag=kitco079-20)
    - More of my HomeKit initiative, this camera has some issues with iOS 14 Home app. I like it a lot though.
- [HomePod - Space Gray](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/space-gray)
    - I have two of these as smart speakers for my living room Apple TV. I have 4 HomePods in total, which, I know. It's ridiculous.
- [Fire TV Stick 4K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QHML21?tag=kitco079-20)
    - This is for the TV being mounted to my bedroom wall tomorrow, August 7th, 2020.
- [Eve Room - Indoor Air Quality Monitor for tracking VOC, temperature & humidity with Apple HomeKit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GKVBYKV?tag=kitco079-20)
    - As someone with really bad allergies, this is a great little utility that I am able to automate with HomeKit. It works for apartments, as renters can't put Nests or Ecobee thermostats in their apartments.
- [ASAKUKI Smart Wi-Fi Essential Oil Diffuser, App Control Compatible with Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C2H2N67/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - I bought a few diffusers to hook up to a couple smart plugs but unfortunately those diffusers need a physical power-on. I bought these more expensive diffusers to make the rooms in my apartment smell great and even better than that, *automated*.
- [VOCOlinc HomeKit Smart Power Strip Multi Outlet Surge Protector Works with Alexa and Google Assistant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083NFNN99/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - I wanted a way to automate turning on the studio lights whenever I record a video. 😉 This was an idea I got from [Eric Welander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thKxeM8zYqY), one of my favorite smart home YouTube creators. Check out his channel if you're into HomeKit.
- [Ring Alarm 5-piece kit (2nd Gen) – home security system](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZDTXJ93/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - As things start adding up in here, and with crime picking up as many people are struggling[^2], I felt increasingly paranoid about the safety of myself and my belongings. I live in the suburbs within a high crime city. I felt like I needed *something*.
- [TP-Link Deco Mesh WiFi System(Deco M5) –Up to 3,800 sq. 2-pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797D6853/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    - Since moving here I have had constant dropouts on my network, despite gigabit speeds. I was also not getting the speeds advertised to me with the ISP's router. I decided to get a mesh system as I have 45 or more devices connected to my network and it has been great so far; faster network speeds, and more.
- [HomePod mini - Space Gray - Apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/space-gray)
  - I got rid of my Sonos One thinking I could use two HomePod Minis as default speaker for the Apple TV 4K I just recently got for my bedroom[^3] but apparently you can't set them as default speakers for your Apple TV 4K just yet. Hopefully that feature is added to the Minis in the next iOS release.

  - I wanted a dedicated recipe machine for the kitchen and maybe another for viewing who is at my door. My apartment complex has okay'd a video doorbell, as long as I don't drill holes in the door, and so I am most likely getting another Echo Show 8 for my office and a Eufy Video Doorbell Camera.

My biggest inspiration for starting this channel, blog, and the like is [Smart Home Solver's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwOBG77Tm8cE24FPxHb_abw). I've devoured all of their content. For starters, check out Reed's Smart Office.


Pretty rad.


[^1]: It is not advisable to waste money. Oh well.
[^2]: It's also near the holidays which always sees an uptick in crime.
