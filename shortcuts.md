Most of the shortcuts I have were built by someone else but as I am spending more time with the app, I am making more and more shortcuts than ever before. As a software engineer, some of the Shortcuts experience is maddening as I don't have a lot of control over control flow, etc. But they're still useful for things I do on my mobile Apple devices.

  Here is a list that I am going to continue to build on. This idea is taken from [Matthew Cassinelli's Siri Shortcuts Library](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/siri-shortcuts-2/siri-shortcuts/).
