These headphones sound *okay* so far. Here's my review.

{% notice warning %}
 I haven't received the Toslink cable to connect the DAC to my iMac. My iMac is a late 2015 which is the last model to offer a Toslink connection to connect different audio output devices to your headphone jack.

## Comfort
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #339e4e; color: #ffffff;">Great</a>

These things are *incredibly light*. I wore them for at least 4 hours while at my desk without my ears hurting. Contrast this with my Audio-Technica MSR7s which I can only wear for a couple hours before they become heavy and cumbersome. This is a welcome change.

## Style/Attractiveness
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #f5a105; color: #ffffff;">Good</a>

They aren't *sexy* in that Audio-Technica or Grado way but they look interesting enough for office use. I don't think I'd wear these outside *per se* but I could see wearing them in an office setting or around the house.

       Not bad but some of the accents are a little much, even for me.

## Portability
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #e0e019; color: #ffffff;">Okay</a>

No case or bag and they don't fold. They are light enough but if you're thinking of traveling or commuting with these, then these are a solid pass.

## Value for Price
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #339e4e; color: #ffffff;">Great</a>

These were $70 *with the DAC*. The reason is because these are the older version of these cans the newer being the AKG k240 MarkII. I went with these because of the DAC. How could you pass on this? Incredible value[^1].

## Sound
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #e0e019; color: #ffffff;">Okay</a>

I *was* going to give this a bad simply because of the amount of distortion when using an equalizer. The bass is overly jarring, the loudness becomes too much and it isn't any enjoyable experience as I am constantly switching the equalizer for different genres of songs.

I am giving this an okay for now because I want to see if there are any improvements with the DAC. I will update this grade when I test it with the DAC.

## Build
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #de1b1b; color: #ffffff;">Bad</a>

These are really flimsy for being from a company like AKG; plastic that seems it would be easy to break, especially on the cups. I twisted them a bit because I was shocked to see how absolutely *flimsy* they were to see if they had any give at all. They do but I can see in a couple years breaking these with normal wear and tear. No bueno. 👎🏾

## Overall conclusion
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #e0e019; color: #ffffff;">Okay</a>

They are fine looking but flimsy and sound can at times be bad. Definitely worth the $70 you're spending at least.

[^1]: Waiting for the DAC as UPS delayed the package with the Toslink cable. It was supposed to arrive today. I will update this review when I get it.
