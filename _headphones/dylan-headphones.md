I am finally back to writing the *Pick of the month*.

This month, my pick is [Dylan Quiet Space Wireless Headphones](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPZLYQV/?tag=thatmacnerd-20).

## Between A BeatBack Pro and a Hard Place

My daily driver for the past year was the [Plantronics BeatBack PRO](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MBWIL0G/?tag=thatmacnerd-20). They are really, really great headphones. They’re heavy and don’t fit my head right [^1] but the controls are on the cups and are easy to use. Twist one way or the other to adjust volume or go to next/previous track. You can also take calls by pressing the left cup’s button. You can easily feel for the buttons which is definitely an improvement over most Bluetooth over-the-head headphones.

That said, I find myself using the Dylan set more.

As you can see, the Dylan’s have a metal band with a fantastic cushion. It fits my head better than any other headphones, wireless or wired [^2].

The Plantronics BeatBack PRO is $155 while the Dylan Quiet Space is $70. The difference in price and quality is most felt in the controls and the sound, though not in the way you’d think.

### Controls Comparison

- Plantronics BeatBack PRO: Excellent controls. This is probably why the headphones are so bulky and heavy. Easy to navigate without seeing them.
- Dylan Quiet Space S1: Controls are inset into the outside of the cups where there are notches for cosmetic purposes. It is hard to feel your way around to the controls without looking initially [^3].

**Winner**: Plantronics BeatBack PRO

### Sound

- Plantronics BeatBack PRO: Heavy bass. Distortion when using an equalizer on your Mac like Boom 2 or [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php). Sync issues with video are pretty bad.
- Dylan Quiet Space S1: Flat sound which works well with equalizers. You can hear mids and highs quite well though not very loud. No noticeable sync issues with video.

**Winner**: Dylan Quiet Space S1

### Fit

- Plantronics: Heavy and tend to fall of my head. Plastic inner headband not good for fros on big heads.
- Dylan Quiet Space: They have a metal band and fit my head so well I am surprised that they only cost $70. The cushion on the cups are *amazing*.

**Winner**: Dylan Quiet Space

### Aesthetics

- Plantronics: Good looking cans just very bulky.
- Dylan Quiet Space: Very good looking cans though the cups are small. The metal makes them look premium when they really are cheap.

**WInner**: Dylan Quiet Space

### Noise Cancellation

- Plantronics: Great noise cancellation but they are open back headphones which means the sound leaks from the headphones. Not ideal if you are on a bus or train; you are liable to annoy your fellow commuters with your black metal.
- Dylan Quiet Space: Also great at noise cancellation. Maybe a bit better than the Plantronics. I am not sure if they are closed back headphones but it is hard to hear the music even when I have my headphones off and sound playing.

**Winner**: Slight edge to Dylan Quiet Space

## Dylan Quiet Space S1 is My Daily Driver

The Dylan’s win out for now as far as what I’m wearing on a regular basis. As soon as I start a dev job I’ll probably buy a pair of AirPods, just to see what everyone is talking about.

[^1]: I have a lot of hair and a big head and the plastic band inside has cracked. They’re not cheap so I don’t expect this behavior.
[^2]: This is probably not the fault of manufacturers. But still.
[^3]: I had to take my headphones off a couple times when I first got them to see where the controls were. Unacceptable.
