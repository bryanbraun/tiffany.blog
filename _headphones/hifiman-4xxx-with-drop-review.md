### Comfort
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #e0e019; color: #ffffff;">Okay</a>

These are *heavy*, and I mean *really, really heavy*. They also suck your head in between the cups.

I wore these with a mask on that I left on by accident and my ears began to hurt within an hour or two. Not recommended for long use.

### Style/Attractiveness
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #339e4e; color: #ffffff;">Great</a>

I'm a sucker for big, bulky headphones so I *really* like the way these look[^1] so my opinion is biased so these get a *Great* from me.

### Portability
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #de1b1b; color: #ffffff;">Bad</a>

These things are big, metal, and *heavy*. There is *no way* to wear these anywhere but at your desk[^2] but that's okay with me. The 'Rona means I don't commute anywhere and I am a desk hermit and hardly leave my office so it's not a big deal for me. I have AirPods Pro to wear when I am out and about[^3].

As you can see below, *most* if not *all* of my headphones are not portable. I don't go anywhere or commute anymore, even pre-Rona.

### Sound
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #f5a105; color: #ffffff;">Good</a>

At first I thought you would need a DAC and you still might. But over the past couple days of using these, they seem to sound better. I honestly don't want to buy a DAC so the more I break these in the better I'll feel.


<a href="#entry-table-of-contents" class="back-to-top">{{ site.data.text[site.locale].back_to_top | default: 'Back to Top' }} &uarr;</a>

### Build
Oh. My. God. These are built solid and heavy, even heavier than the beyerdynamics I have. Both are metal but these are...just...monsters. I'm pretty sure if I swung at someone with these in my hands they'd get a bump whereever I hit them, they're *tanks*.

### Value for Price
<a class="fasc-button fasc-size-medium fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium" style="background-color: #339e4e; color: #ffffff;">Great</a>

I paid very little for these. These were a collab between Drop, formerly Massdrop, and HiFiman. I've been wanting a pair of HiFiman headphones since [watching Marco on Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy5pzN-wLxg) wearing HiFiman headphones, I've wanted a pair. Not at $350 however. These collabs from Drop were less than $170, which is the *right price*. The quality for that price is significant. You won't find better made, better quality headphones than these for such a low price.

<a href="#entry-table-of-contents" class="back-to-top">{{ site.data.text[site.locale].back_to_top | default: 'Back to Top' }} &uarr;</a>

## Conclusion
I have too many headphones now. I switch them up every so often but I think there is only one more pair to get as I don't really like the Bose's bluetooth, and that is the Sony Bluetooth headphones, for $349, what I didn't want to spend on the HiFimans, ironically.

It is what it is, it be what it be, and it do what it do.
